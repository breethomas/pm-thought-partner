# AI Cost Check Command

Calculate the **true cost of your AI feature at scale** to validate economic viability.

**Works with:**
- **Linear MCP / GitHub MCP** - Optional: Can attach cost analysis to an issue as comment
- **Manual** - Describe your AI feature directly (recommended for detailed analysis)

## What This Does

Prevents expensive surprises by modeling AI costs BEFORE launch:
- Cost per request
- Cost per user per month at different scales
- Percentage of revenue consumed by AI
- Cost optimization opportunities

**Philosophy:** "AI products have marginal costs. Inference scales with usage." Unlike traditional SaaS (fixed infrastructure), every user interaction costs money.

## Usage

```
/ai-cost-check [feature-name]
```

**Examples:**
- `/ai-cost-check "product recommendations"` - Calculate recommendation costs
- `/ai-cost-check ENG-245` - Analyze Linear issue for AI costs
- `/ai-cost-check --model gpt-4` - Specify model explicitly
- `/ai-cost-check "email composer" --scale 10000` - Model at 10K users
- `/ai-cost-check --compare` - Compare cost across different models

## What Happens

1. **Understands your AI feature:**
   - What model are you using? (GPT-4, Claude, custom)
   - How many API calls per user action?
   - Input/output token estimates
   - Additional costs (embeddings, vector DB, etc.)

2. **Calculates costs at scale:**
   - Per request
   - Per user per day/month
   - At 100 users, 1K, 10K, 100K users
   - Annual run rate at each scale

3. **Compares to revenue:**
   - % of revenue consumed by AI
   - Break-even analysis
   - Sustainability assessment

4. **Identifies optimization opportunities:**
   - Caching potential
   - Cheaper models for simple queries
   - Batch processing opportunities
   - Prompt length reduction

5. **Returns detailed breakdown** with warnings if unsustainable

## Example Output

```
üí∞ AI Cost Check: Product Recommendations

FEATURE DETAILS:
- Model: GPT-4 Turbo
- Use case: Generate personalized product recommendations
- Calls per recommendation: 1 (no chaining)
- Average input: 1,500 tokens (user profile + product catalog context)
- Average output: 300 tokens (5 recommendations with reasoning)

---

üìä COST BREAKDOWN (Per Request)

Input Tokens:  1,500 @ $0.01/1K  = $0.015
Output Tokens:   300 @ $0.03/1K  = $0.009
Total per request:               = $0.024

Additional costs:
- Embeddings (if using RAG): $0.0001 per request
- Vector DB query: ~$0.00005 per request
- Total system cost: $0.024 per recommendation

---

üìà COST AT SCALE

Assumptions:
- Average user requests 3 recommendations per day
- 30 days per month
- $0.024 per recommendation

| Users | Requests/Month | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|-------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| 100   | 9,000          | $216         | $2,592      |
| 1,000 | 90,000         | $2,160       | $25,920     |
| 10,000| 900,000        | $21,600      | $259,200    |
| 100,000| 9,000,000     | $216,000     | $2,592,000  |

‚ö†Ô∏è VIABILITY ANALYSIS

Your pricing: $20/user/month

| Scale   | Revenue/Month | AI Cost/Month | AI % of Revenue |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 100     | $2,000        | $216          | 10.8% ‚úÖ        |
| 1,000   | $20,000       | $2,160        | 10.8% ‚úÖ        |
| 10,000  | $200,000      | $21,600       | 10.8% ‚úÖ        |
| 100,000 | $2,000,000    | $216,000      | 10.8% ‚úÖ        |

‚úÖ SUSTAINABLE: 10.8% of revenue at all scales
   (Industry benchmark: AI costs should be <20% of revenue)

However, note:
- This assumes 3 recommendations/user/day
- If usage is 10x higher (30/day), costs become 108% of revenue ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Monitor actual usage patterns closely

---

üí° COST OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

1. **Caching** (Potential savings: 40-60%)
   - Cache frequent queries (e.g., "laptop under $500")
   - Reuse recommendations for similar user profiles
   - Estimated savings: $8,640/month at 10K users

2. **Model Selection** (Potential savings: 70%)
   - Use GPT-3.5 for simple recommendations: $0.007/request (vs $0.024)
   - Use GPT-4 only for complex/personalized requests
   - Estimated savings: $15,120/month at 10K users

3. **Prompt Optimization** (Potential savings: 20-30%)
   - Reduce input tokens (1,500 ‚Üí 1,000 with better context selection)
   - Use shorter examples in prompt
   - Estimated savings: $4,320/month at 10K users

4. **Batch Processing** (Potential savings: 15-25%)
   - Pre-generate recommendations for common queries
   - Refresh daily instead of real-time
   - Estimated savings: $3,240/month at 10K users

TOTAL POTENTIAL SAVINGS: $31,320/month at 10K users (145% of current cost)
Optimized cost: $13,608/month (6.8% of revenue)

üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS

‚úÖ CURRENT STATE:
- Costs are sustainable at 10.8% of revenue
- Within industry benchmarks (<20%)

‚ö†Ô∏è WATCH OUT FOR:
- Usage spikes (what if users request 10x more recommendations?)
- Feature creep (adding AI to more features multiplies costs)
- Model price changes (API pricing can change)

üìã ACTION ITEMS:

Priority 1 (Do Before Launch):
1. Implement basic caching for repeat queries
2. Set up cost monitoring alerts (warn if >15% of revenue)
3. Define usage limits per user (prevent abuse)

Priority 2 (First Month):
4. Test GPT-3.5 for simple recommendations (A/B test quality vs cost)
5. Optimize prompt length (reduce input tokens by 30%)
6. Monitor actual usage patterns vs assumptions

Priority 3 (When Scaling):
7. Consider fine-tuned smaller model (if cost becomes issue)
8. Implement tiered pricing based on AI usage

üìä COMPARISON: Different Models

| Model | Cost/Request | Cost at 10K users/mo | Quality | Recommendation |
|-------|--------------|----------------------|---------|----------------|
| GPT-4 Turbo | $0.024 | $21,600 | Excellent | ‚úÖ Current choice |
| GPT-3.5 Turbo | $0.007 | $6,300 | Good | üí° Test for simple cases |
| Claude 3 Haiku | $0.006 | $5,400 | Good | üí° Alternative option |
| Claude 3 Sonnet | $0.018 | $16,200 | Excellent | üí° Slightly cheaper |

Recommendation: Start with GPT-4 for quality. Test GPT-3.5 for 50% of requests (simple queries). Could save $7,650/month.

üö® RED FLAGS (None detected)

‚úÖ Cost per user ($2.16/month) is <15% of revenue ($20/month)

‚úÖ Business model can support AI costs

If any were true, would flag:
‚ùå AI costs >30% of revenue (unsustainable)

‚ùå Costs grow faster than revenue (broken economics)
‚ùå Single point of failure (one model, no alternatives)
```
