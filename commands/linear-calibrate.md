# Linear Workspace Calibration

Analyze a Linear workspace against Linear methodology best practices. Produces a structured health report with explicit pass/fail thresholds.

## Prerequisites

- Linear MCP must be configured
- Run this from any directory with Linear access

## Instructions

### Step 1: Fetch Data

**CRITICAL: Always use `limit: 250` to avoid default truncation.**

Fetch in this order:
```
1. list_teams with limit: 250
2. list_projects with limit: 250
3. list_issue_labels with limit: 250
4. list_issues with limit: 100 (sample for quality check)
```

Record the counts before proceeding.

### Step 2: Apply Thresholds

Use these EXACT thresholds. No interpretation - just apply them:

#### Team Structure
| Count | Rating | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 4-15 teams | 🟢 | Healthy - matches Linear guidance |
| 16-30 teams | 🟡 | Review - may have team proliferation |
| 31+ teams | 🔴 | Problem - likely labels-as-teams or org debt |

#### Team Size (members per team)
| Average | Rating | Meaning |
|---------|--------|---------|
| 4+ members | 🟢 | Healthy team sizes |
| 2-3 members | 🟡 | Small teams - consider consolidating |
| 0-1 members | 🔴 | Ghost teams - archive or consolidate |

#### Archive Teams (teams with no activity 90+ days)
| Percentage | Rating | Meaning |
|------------|--------|---------|
| <10% | 🟢 | Well-maintained |
| 10-25% | 🟡 | Some cleanup needed |
| >25% | 🔴 | Significant workspace debt |

#### Project Health
| Projects without leads | Rating |
|------------------------|--------|
| <10% | 🟢 |
| 10-30% | 🟡 |
| >30% | 🔴 |

| Projects without dates | Rating |
|------------------------|--------|
| <20% | 🟢 |
| 20-50% | 🟡 |
| >50% | 🔴 |

#### Backlog Staleness (issues untouched 60+ days)
| Percentage | Rating |
|------------|--------|
| <20% | 🟢 |
| 20-40% | 🟡 |
| >40% | 🔴 |

#### Label Hygiene
| Count | Rating | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 10-25 labels | 🟢 | Minimal and focused |
| 26-50 labels | 🟡 | Getting complex |
| 51+ labels | 🔴 | Label sprawl - needs cleanup |

#### Issue Quality (sample check)
Check 20 recent issues for:
- User story format ("As a...") = 🔴 per Linear methodology
- Vague titles (<4 words, no verb) = 🟡
- Missing descriptions on complex issues = 🟡

### Step 3: Output Report

**USE THIS EXACT FORMAT:**

```markdown
# Linear Workspace Calibration Report

**Workspace:** [name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Analyzed:** [X teams, Y projects, Z labels, N issues sampled]

## Health Indicators

| Dimension | Count | Rating | Finding |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| Team Count | [N] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | [one-line assessment] |
| Team Sizes | [avg] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | [one-line assessment] |
| Stale Teams | [N%] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | [one-line assessment] |
| Project Ownership | [N%] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | [one-line assessment] |
| Project Dates | [N%] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | [one-line assessment] |
| Backlog Staleness | [N%] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | [one-line assessment] |
| Label Count | [N] | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | [one-line assessment] |
| Issue Quality | — | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | [one-line assessment] |

**Overall Health:** [🟢 Healthy / 🟡 Needs Attention / 🔴 Action Required]

(Overall = 🔴 if any dimension is 🔴, 🟡 if any is 🟡, else 🟢)

---

## Red Flags

List ALL dimensions rated 🔴 or 🟡:

1. **[Dimension]** (🔴/🟡): [Specific problem and why it matters]
2. **[Dimension]** (🔴/🟡): [Specific problem and why it matters]

If no red flags: "No red flags identified. Workspace follows Linear best practices."

---

## Teams Overview

**Active Teams ([N]):**
[List teams with recent activity, grouped by function]

**Stale/Archive Teams ([N]):**
[List teams with no activity 90+ days - candidates for archival]

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
[List 1-3 specific actions for any 🔴 items]

### Near-Term (This Month)
[List 1-3 specific actions for any 🟡 items]

### Maintenance
[List ongoing practices to maintain health]

---

## Methodology

Thresholds based on Linear Method (linear.app/method):
- Teams should be durable groups, not topics (4-15 recommended)
- Issues not user stories
- Projects need owners and dates
- Keep backlogs lean

### Step 4: Offer Next Steps

After the report, ask:
```
What would you like to explore?
1. Deep-dive on a specific red flag
2. Run /lno-prioritize on a specific team's backlog
3. See team details for consolidation candidates
4. Export this report
```

## Edge Cases

### No Linear MCP
```
Linear MCP is not configured. To run workspace calibration:
1. Get a Linear API key (Settings > Account > Security & Access)
2. Configure the Linear MCP server

Alternatively, describe your workspace and I'll help analyze it manually.
```

### Very Large Workspace (250+ teams)
If team count equals 250:
```
⚠️ This workspace has 250+ teams (API limit reached).
This is an extreme case of team proliferation.

Rating: 🔴 SEVERE
Recommendation: Immediate audit required. Linear recommends 4-15 teams.
```

### Empty/New Workspace
If <5 teams and <10 projects:
```
This appears to be a new or minimal workspace.
Instead of a health check, would you like guidance on:
- Setting up team structure
- Establishing conventions
- Avoiding common pitfalls
```
