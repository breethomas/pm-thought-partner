description: Find which fit is broken before you burn cash scaling

# Four Fits Command

**Before you scale, all four fits must work. If one is broken, scaling fails.**

Most companies scale too early. They have product-market fit and think they're ready. They're not. You need all four:

1. **Market ↔ Product** - Do customers want this?
2. **Product ↔ Channel** - Can you reach customers efficiently?
3. **Channel ↔ Model** - Can your business model support acquisition costs?
4. **Model ↔ Market** - Can you monetize this market profitably?

**One broken fit = don't scale yet.** Fix it first.

**Works with:**
- **Linear MCP / GitHub MCP** - Optional: Can attach analysis to an issue
- **Manual** - Provide context directly (recommended)

**Philosophy:** "All four fits must align for $100M+ growth. Scaling with misaligned fits burns cash." - Brian Balfour

## Usage

```
/four-fits
```

**Examples:**
- `/four-fits` - Full assessment of current state
- `/four-fits --validate` - Pre-scale validation checklist
- `/four-fits --diagnose` - Identify which fit is blocking growth
- `/four-fits --market "SMB SaaS"` - Specify market explicitly

## What Happens

1. **Gathers context** about your product:
   - What's your market? (SMB, enterprise, consumer)
   - What's your product? (feature set, positioning)
   - What's your primary channel? (paid, viral, content, sales)
   - What's your business model? (SaaS, marketplace, freemium, transaction)

2. **Assesses each fit** independently:
   - Questions to validate fit strength
   - Evidence required
   - Common anti-patterns
   - Confidence level (Validated / Needs Work / Misaligned)

3. **Identifies misalignments:**
   - Which fits are blocking scale?
   - Where are the gaps?
   - What validation is needed?

4. **Returns** detailed assessment with:
   - Fit-by-fit analysis
   - Overall readiness score
   - Recommended fixes
   - When to scale (or not)

5. **Provides validation activities** to de-risk each fit

## Example Output

```
🎯 Four Fits Assessment: Project Management SaaS

CONTEXT:
- Market: SMB teams (5-50 employees)
- Product: Collaborative project management tool
- Primary Channel: Paid search + content marketing
- Business Model: $20/user/month SaaS subscription

---

FIT #1: MARKET ↔ PRODUCT (✅ VALIDATED)

Questions:
✅ Is there a real pain point in this market?
   → Yes - SMBs struggle with coordination across remote teams

✅ Is our product solving that pain?
   → Yes - 80% retention, high NPS (45)

✅ Do customers choose us over alternatives?
   → Yes - win rate vs competitors 60%

✅ Are customers willing to pay?
   → Yes - conversion free → paid is 25%

Evidence:
- Retention: 80% (strong)
- NPS: 45 (excellent)
- PMF survey: 48% "very disappointed" (above 40% threshold)
- Customer interviews: pain point validated across 30+ interviews

Confidence: ✅ VALIDATED

Why: Multiple strong signals. Product-market fit is real.

---

FIT #2: PRODUCT ↔ CHANNEL (❌ BROKEN)

Questions:
❌ Can customers discover us through this channel?
   → Paid search works. Content doesn't (only 5% of traffic).

❌ Is our product suited to this channel?
   → NO. Paid search needs instant value.
   → Your product takes 7 days to show value.
   → Users churn before they see why they should pay.

❌ Can we scale this channel 10x?
   → NO. CPCs up 40% in 6 months (channel saturating).
   → You're dependent on one expensive, competitive channel.

THE PROBLEM:
- You're trying to scale paid acquisition
- But your product takes 7 days to activate users
- Paid channels need instant "aha moments"
- Activation rate is 30% (should be 50%+)
- CPCs are rising, making this worse

FIX OPTIONS:
1. **Drastically improve onboarding** (7 days → <1 day)
   - Prototype faster onboarding in Cursor this week
   - Test with 50 users
   - This is your most direct path

2. **Change channels** (stop scaling paid, focus content/viral)
   - Content SEO works for slower onboarding
   - Takes 6-12 months to compound
   - Run /growth-loops to explore viral options

3. **Don't scale yet**
   - Product-channel mismatch will burn cash
   - Fix onboarding first, then scale

Verdict: ❌ BROKEN - Fix onboarding OR change channels before scaling

---

FIT #3: CHANNEL ↔ MODEL (✅ VALIDATED)

Questions:
✅ Does our pricing support customer acquisition costs?
   → Yes - LTV $1,200, CAC $400 (3:1 ratio)

✅ Is payback period acceptable?
   → Yes - 6 months (standard for SaaS)

✅ Can we profitably acquire customers at scale?
   → Yes - unit economics are healthy

Evidence:
- LTV/CAC: 3:1 (healthy, target is >3)
- Payback: 6 months (acceptable)
- Gross margin: 85% (strong for SaaS)
- Churn: 20% annual (room for improvement but not blocking)

Confidence: ✅ VALIDATED

Why: Unit economics are solid. Model supports the channel.

However: If channel saturation continues (CPCs rising), this fit could degrade.

---

FIT #4: MODEL ↔ MARKET (⚠️ NEEDS WORK)

Questions:
✅ Can this market support our pricing?
   → Yes - SMBs can pay $20/user/month

⚠️ Is our TAM large enough for our ambitions?
   → Maybe - 10M SMBs globally, but hard to reach

❌ Can we expand within accounts?
   → Struggling - average team size is 8 users, not growing

❌ Does this market align with our long-term model?
   → Questionable - SMBs have high churn (limited budgets)

Evidence:
- TAM: 10M SMBs (large enough for $100M+ business)
- Average deal size: $160/month (8 users × $20)
- Expansion revenue: Only 10% (most teams don't grow)
- Market churn: Higher than enterprise (budget sensitivity)

Confidence: ⚠️ NEEDS WORK

Issues:
1. Limited account expansion (teams don't grow)
2. SMB churn higher than enterprise
3. Hard to reach upper end of SMB market (50-person teams)

📋 Fixes Required:
1. Add enterprise tier to expand upmarket (bigger teams, lower churn)
2. Increase expansion revenue (upsells, premium features)
3. Consider moving upmarket to mid-market (50-200 employees)

Alternative: Accept SMB limitations, optimize for efficiency vs growth

📊 OVERALL ASSESSMENT

Fit Alignment: 2/4 Validated, 2/4 Need Work

| Fit | Status | Blocking Scale? |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
| Market ↔ Product | ✅ Validated | No |
| Product ↔ Channel | ⚠️ Needs Work | Yes |
| Channel ↔ Model | ✅ Validated | No |
| Model ↔ Market | ⚠️ Needs Work | Partially |

---

🚨 SCALE READINESS: ❌ NOT READY

Recommendation: **DO NOT SCALE YET**

Why:
- Product-Channel fit needs fixing (onboarding too slow, channel saturating)
- Model-Market fit needs work (limited expansion, high churn)
- Scaling now would burn cash without compounding returns

---

🎯 PRIORITIZED FIXES (Before Scaling)

Priority 1 (Blocking): Product ↔ Channel Fit
1. Reduce time-to-value from 7 days → 2 days
   - Impact: Activation rate 30% → 50%+
   - Effort: 1-2 months
   - Validation: A/B test new onboarding flow

2. Build viral loop to diversify channels
   - Impact: Reduce paid dependency
   - Effort: 1 quarter
   - See: /growth-loops

3. Scale content SEO from 5% → 30% of traffic
   - Impact: Lower blended CAC
   - Effort: 6-12 months (but start now)

Priority 2 (Important): Model ↔ Market Fit
4. Move upmarket to mid-market (50-200 employee companies)
   - Impact: Lower churn, higher expansion
   - Effort: 2-3 quarters
   - Validation: Run 10 mid-market pilots

5. Increase expansion revenue (upsells)
   - Impact: LTV increases 20-30%
   - Effort: 1-2 quarters

📅 TIMELINE TO SCALE READINESS

Conservative estimate: 9-12 months

Month 1-3: Fix Product-Channel fit
- Ship faster onboarding
- Build viral invite loop
- Start content SEO program

Month 4-6: Validate improvements
- Measure activation rate improvement
- Track viral coefficient
- Monitor SEO traffic growth

Month 7-9: Address Model-Market fit
- Launch mid-market offering
- Pilot with 10 larger customers
- Build upsell/expansion features

Month 10-12: Final validation
- Rerun /four-fits assessment
- Validate all fits are aligned
- THEN scale

Impatient timeline: 6 months (risky)
Could fix Product-Channel fit in 3 months, validate in 3 more, then scale.
Risk: Model-Market issues could bite later.

💡 KEY INSIGHTS

✅ STRENGTHS:
- Strong product-market fit (retention, NPS, PMF survey all excellent)
- Healthy unit economics (3:1 LTV/CAC)
- Clear customer pain point

⚠️ BLOCKERS:
- Onboarding too slow for paid acquisition (7-day time-to-value)
- Paid channel saturating (CPCs up 40%)
- Limited account expansion (SMB teams don't grow)

🔄 INTERDEPENDENCIES:
- Fixing Product-Channel fit enables scaling content/viral (slower onboarding → higher activation → better viral loops)
- Moving upmarket fixes Model-Market fit BUT requires different messaging/features
- All four fits must align before aggressive scaling

📋 NEXT ACTIONS:
1. Run /lno-prioritize on roadmap - focus on Leverage work (onboarding, viral loop)
2. Prototype faster onboarding experience (2-week spike)
3. A/B test new onboarding vs current (measure activation improvement)
4. Design viral invite loop (see /growth-loops)
5. Rerun /four-fits after fixes (6 months)
