# LNO Prioritize Command

Apply the **LNO Prioritization Framework** (Aakash Gupta) to categorize your Linear issues by impact level.

## What This Does

Analyzes your Linear issues and categorizes them as:
- **Leverage (L):** 10x impact tasks - your highest priority strategic work
- **Neutral (N):** Regular impact tasks - important but not transformational
- **Overhead (O):** Minimal impact tasks - necessary evils to minimize

## Usage

```
/lno-prioritize
```

**Optional parameters:**
- `/lno-prioritize --team [team-name]` - Categorize specific team's issues
- `/lno-prioritize --project [project-name]` - Categorize specific project
- `/lno-prioritize --label` - Auto-add Linear labels (leverage/neutral/overhead)
- `/lno-prioritize --current-sprint` - Only analyze current sprint issues

## What Happens

1. **Fetches Linear issues** via MCP (requires Linear connection)
2. **Applies LNO framework** from PM Thought Partner skill
3. **Categorizes each issue** based on:
   - Strategic importance
   - Impact potential
   - Time investment required
   - Compounding value
4. **Returns analysis** with:
   - Issue title and ID
   - LNO category assignment
   - Reasoning for categorization
   - Recommended time allocation
5. **Optionally updates Linear** with labels (if `--label` flag used)

## Example Output

```
üìä LNO Prioritization Results

üöÄ LEVERAGE (10x impact - be a perfectionist):
- [ENG-245] Rebuild recommendation engine
  Reason: Core product differentiator, compounds over time

- [ENG-198] Product strategy for Q2
  Reason: Foundational decision affecting all downstream work

üìà NEUTRAL (Regular impact - do good enough work):
- [ENG-301] Update onboarding flow copy
  Reason: Important but not transformational

- [ENG-276] Add analytics to checkout page
  Reason: Useful data but incremental improvement

‚öôÔ∏è OVERHEAD (Minimal impact - do quickly):
- [ENG-312] Reformat PRD template
  Reason: Administrative work, no strategic value

- [ENG-288] Update Linear labels
  Reason: Organizational cleanup

üí° Recommendations:
- Spend 60% of PM time on Leverage tasks
- Spend 30% on Neutral tasks (aim for C+/B- quality)
- Minimize Overhead to 10% (automate or delegate where possible)
```

## Requirements

- ‚úÖ PM Thought Partner plugin installed
- ‚úÖ Linear MCP server configured (`claude mcp add linear`)
- ‚úÖ Linear authentication completed

## Without Linear MCP

If you don't have Linear MCP configured, you can still use the framework manually:

```
Apply the LNO framework to these issues: [paste issue list]
```

**Framework:** Aakash Gupta (based on Shreyas Doshi)
**Best for:** Sprint planning, backlog grooming, time management
**AI-era adaptation:** Focus on leverage work (vision, strategy) while AI handles neutral/overhead tasks
