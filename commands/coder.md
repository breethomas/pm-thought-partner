# CODER Framework Command

Apply **Brian Balfour's CODER Framework** to systematically drive AI adoption across your organization.

## What This Does

Guides you through creating an AI adoption plan using the CODER framework:
- **C**onstraints - Make new behavior easier than old behavior
- **O**wnership - Assign clear responsibility
- **D**irectives - Create specific, actionable instructions
- **E**xpectations - Set measurable goals
- **R**ewards - Tie to career progression

## Usage

```
/coder
```

**Optional parameters:**
- `/coder --diagnose` - Identify your primary adoption barrier
- `/coder --team [team-name]` - Create plan for specific team
- `/coder --export` - Generate implementation doc

## What Happens

1. **Diagnoses your situation:**
   - Company size and structure
   - Current AI adoption level
   - Primary barriers (political, retrofitting, procurement, knowledge, permission)
   - Team composition (catalysts 15-20%, converts 60-70%, anchors 15-20%)

2. **Guides through CODER framework:**
   - Designs 1-2 **constraints** for your context
   - Assigns **ownership** (CEO/functional leaders)
   - Creates 2-3 **directives** per function
   - Sets specific, universal, measurable **expectations**
   - Defines how to tie to **rewards** (performance reviews, leveling)

3. **Generates implementation plan:**
   - Immediate actions
   - 30/60/90 day milestones
   - Metrics to track
   - Common pitfalls to avoid

## Example Output

```
🎯 CODER Framework Implementation Plan

📊 DIAGNOSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Company: Series B SaaS (85 people)
Current state: AI-first memo written, low adoption
Primary barrier: PERMISSION (fear of doing something wrong)
Team breakdown: 15% catalysts, 65% converts, 20% anchors

🔧 C - CONSTRAINTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Make AI behavior easier than old behavior:

1. **Time Constraint**
   Full-company AI hackathon - March 15-19
   Everyone participates, regular work paused

2. **Process Constraint**
   "I only review work demonstrating AI augmentation"
   - PRDs must include AI prototype section
   - Designs must show AI tool usage
   - Code reviews check for Copilot usage

👤 O - OWNERSHIP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CEO: Overall cultural shift
VP Product: Product team directives
VP Eng: Engineering team directives
VP Design: Design team directives

Escalation path: Weekly CEO check-ins on blockers

📋 D - DIRECTIVES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Product Team (2-3 specific directives):
1. All feature explorations must include AI prototype before design review
2. Weekly PM sync includes "AI tool of the week" sharing
3. PRDs include AI capability assessment section

Engineering Team:
1. All code reviews must use GitHub Copilot
2. Pair programming sessions alternate AI driver/observer
3. Sprint retros include AI tool effectiveness discussion

Design Team:
1. All design exploration uses Figma AI features
2. Design critiques include AI generation process
3. User research incorporates AI prototype testing

📊 E - EXPECTATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Specific, Universal, Measurable:

✓ 100% of PMs prototype features with AI before design (not "use AI effectively")
✓ 90%+ of code commits show Copilot usage (tracked via GitHub)
✓ All design files include AI generation layer documentation
✓ AI fluency level assessed quarterly (Aware→Exploratory→Proficient→Advanced→Expert)

🏆 R - REWARDS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Tie to career progression:

Performance Reviews (next cycle):
- "Demonstrates AI-augmented work" = evaluation criteria
- "Shares AI learnings with team" = collaboration rating factor

Leveling Guides (update by end of Q1):
- L3→L4 PM: "Prototypes solutions with AI tools"
- L4→L5 PM: "Leads team in AI-augmented discovery"
- Senior+ PM: "Innovates new AI-powered workflows"

Promotion Criteria:
- AI capability advancement required for all promotions
- "Stagnant in AI adoption" = blocks advancement

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📅 IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

Week 1:
✓ CEO announces CODER framework rollout
✓ Schedule March hackathon
✓ Update job descriptions with AI requirements

Week 2-4:
✓ Functional leaders create team-specific directives
✓ HR updates performance review templates
✓ Set up AI usage tracking

Month 2:
✓ Run company hackathon
✓ Measure baseline AI fluency
✓ Begin weekly check-ins

Month 3:
✓ First 30-day assessment
✓ Adjust directives based on feedback
✓ Address anchors (binary choices)

📈 METRICS TO TRACK
- % of work showing AI augmentation
- AI fluency scores by team
- Blocker escalations resolved
- Catalyst→Convert→Anchor movement
```
