# PMF Survey Command

Create and analyze a **Product-Market Fit survey** using Rahul Vohra's Superhuman framework.

## What This Does

Guides you through running Sean Ellis's PMF survey with Rahul Vohra's systematic approach:
- The magic "very disappointed" >40% benchmark
- Four-question survey structure
- Segment analysis by high-expectation customers
- Actionable improvement plan

## Usage

```
/pmf-survey
```

**Optional parameters:**
- `/pmf-survey --create` - Generate survey questions
- `/pmf-survey --analyze [data]` - Analyze existing survey results
- `/pmf-survey --export` - Export survey to Typeform/Google Forms format

## What Happens

### Mode 1: Create Survey

1. **Validates readiness:**
   - Do you have users who experienced the core product?
   - Have they used it at least twice in last 2 weeks?

2. **Generates four-question survey:**
   - Q1: How disappointed if you could no longer use [product]?
   - Q2: What type of people would most benefit?
   - Q3: What is the main benefit you receive?
   - Q4: What can be improved?

3. **Provides implementation guidance:**
   - Who to survey (active users, not everyone)
   - Survey tool recommendations
   - Sample size calculations

### Mode 2: Analyze Results

1. **Calculates PMF score:**
   - % who answered "very disappointed"
   - Benchmark: >40% = PMF, <40% = not yet

2. **Segments users:**
   - Very disappointed (supporters)
   - Somewhat disappointed (neutrals)
   - Not disappointed (detractors)

3. **Identifies high-expectation customers:**
   - From "what type of people" answers
   - Your most discerning potential users

4. **Generates improvement plan:**
   - What to double down on (from supporters)
   - What to ignore (from detractors)
   - How to convert neutrals

## Example Output (Analysis Mode)

✅ DOUBLE DOWN (you have PMF, now optimize):

1. Focus on high-expectation customer:
   "Technical founders at early-stage startups"

2. Amplify core benefits:
   - Time-saving documentation
   - Code review improvements
   - Faster onboarding

3. Build supporter requests:
   Priority 1: Better GitHub integration
   Priority 2: Slack notifications
   Priority 3: Team analytics

4. Ignore detractor feedback:
   - Wrong pricing expectations = wrong segment
   - "Too focused" = they're not your market

🎯 GROWTH STRATEGY

Now that you have PMF (58% > 40%):
- Segment marketing to "technical founders at early-stage startups"
- Lead with "Save 10+ hours/week on documentation"
