# Issue Audit

Understand how a team organizes and writes issues in Linear. Helps PMs onboarding to new teams learn conventions, see examples, and know what questions to ask.

## Prerequisites

- Linear MCP must be configured

## Usage

```
/issue-audit [team name]
```

Examples:
- `/issue-audit Customer Experience`
- `/issue-audit Platform`
- `/issue-audit "Data Engineering"`

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Fetch Organization Structure

**These calls are lightweight and won't hit token limits.**

```
get_team(query: "[name]")
list_issue_labels(team: "[name]")
list_issue_statuses(team: "[name]")
list_cycles(team: "[team_id]", type: "current")
list_cycles(team: "[team_id]", type: "next")
```

If team not found, use `list_teams()` and suggest similar names.

From this, extract:
- Team metadata (key, member count if available)
- Label taxonomy (what categories exist, any hierarchy)
- Workflow states (the team's process from triage to done)
- Cycle cadence (are they using sprints? what duration?)

### Phase 2: Surgical Issue Samples

**Fetch exactly 9 issues: 3 per key state.**

```
list_issues(team: "[name]", state: "In Progress", limit: 3)
list_issues(team: "[name]", state: "Done", limit: 3, updatedAt: "-P7D")
list_issues(team: "[name]", state: "Backlog", limit: 3)
```

Note: State names vary by team. Use the actual state names from Phase 1. Map to:
- **Active work**: States of type "started" (In Progress, In Review, etc.)
- **Completed**: States of type "completed" (Done, Completed, etc.)
- **Waiting**: States of type "backlog" or "unstarted" (Backlog, To Do, etc.)

If a state returns no issues, that's useful information too.

### Phase 3: Analyze Patterns

From the 9 sample issues, observe and report:

**Structure patterns:**
- Do any have `parentId`? (using sub-issues)
- Do any have children? (using epics/parent issues)
- Are labels applied consistently?
- Are issues assigned to cycles?

**Quality patterns:**
- Do descriptions exist? (note which have content vs empty)
- Are titles clear and specific, or vague?
- Is there a consistent format? (e.g., "As a user...", acceptance criteria)
- Any patterns in how they write issues?

**Don't calculate percentages** - just describe what you observe in the samples.

### Phase 4: Output Report

**USE THIS FORMAT:**

```markdown
# Issue Audit: [Team Name]

**Team Key:** [KEY]
**Workflow States:** [N] states
**Labels:** [N] labels
**Cycles:** [Active/Not using cycles]

---

## How This Team Organizes Work

### Workflow
[Describe the states from left to right]

Example: "Issues flow through: Triage → Backlog → Selected → In Progress → In Review → Done. There's also a Blocked state for issues waiting on dependencies."

### Labels
[Describe the label taxonomy]

Example: "The team uses 12 labels organized into groups:
- **Type:** Bug, Feature, Tech Debt, Chore
- **Area:** Frontend, Backend, API, Infrastructure
- **Priority:** P0, P1, P2 (though priority field may also be used)"

### Cycles
[Describe cycle usage]

Example: "The team runs 2-week cycles. Current cycle: Dec 16-30. Issues are assigned to cycles for sprint planning."

Or: "This team doesn't appear to use cycles for sprint planning."

## Sample Issues

### Active Work (In Progress)
| Issue | Title | Has Description | Labels |
|-------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| [ID] | [title] | Yes/No | [labels] |
| [ID] | [title] | Yes/No | [labels] |
| [ID] | [title] | Yes/No | [labels] |

### Recently Completed
| Issue | Title | Has Description | Labels |
|-------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| [ID] | [title] | Yes/No | [labels] |
| [ID] | [title] | Yes/No | [labels] |
| [ID] | [title] | Yes/No | [labels] |

### In Backlog
| Issue | Title | Has Description | Labels |
|-------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| [ID] | [title] | Yes/No | [labels] |
| [ID] | [title] | Yes/No | [labels] |
| [ID] | [title] | Yes/No | [labels] |

## Patterns Observed

### What I Notice
[Bullet points of patterns from the 9 samples]

Examples:
- "5 of 9 samples have descriptions; the 4 without are all in Backlog"
- "Titles are specific and action-oriented (e.g., 'Add retry logic to payment webhook')"
- "Labels are used consistently - every issue has a Type label"
- "2 issues are sub-issues (have parentId), suggesting they use parent/child for larger work"
- "No issues in the sample are assigned to cycles"

### Conventions to Follow
[Infer conventions a new PM should follow]

Examples:
- "Use Type labels on every issue"
- "Parent issues for epics, child issues for implementation tasks"
- "Descriptions expected for features, optional for bugs"

---

## Explore Further

Based on what you've seen, here are questions you might want to ask:

**See specific issues:**
- "Show me issue [ID]" - get full details on any issue from the samples
- "Show me 3 parent issues" - see how epics are structured

**Explore by label:**
- "Show me 3 issues labeled [Feature/Bug/etc.]"
- "Show me issues labeled [specific label you noticed]"

**Explore by state:**
- "Show me what's blocked"
- "Show me what's in review"

**Quality deep-dive:**
- "Show me an issue with a good description" - I'll pick the best from samples
- "Show me issues without descriptions that are in progress"

**Compare projects:**
- "Run /issue-audit on [another team]" - see if patterns differ

## Notes for Claude

- **Don't apologize for limited data.** 9 samples is enough to observe patterns.
- **Be specific about what you see.** "5 of 9 have descriptions" not "most have descriptions."
- **Infer conventions.** Help the PM understand what's expected on this team.
- **Offer concrete next steps.** The drill-down prompts should use actual labels/states from this team.

## Relationship to Other Commands

```
/linear-calibrate        → Workspace-wide health (30,000 ft view)
         ↓

```

- `/linear-calibrate` flags workspace-level issues
- `/project-health` checks if a specific project is on track
- `/issue-audit` helps PM understand how a team works
