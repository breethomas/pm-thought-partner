# Product-Market Fit Survey (Superhuman Framework)

**Author:** Rahul Vohra
**Category:** Measurement / PMF
**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

Rahul Vohra (CEO of Superhuman) developed a quantitative framework for measuring and improving product-market fit. The framework is based on Sean Ellis's original question but adds segmentation and actionable analysis.

## The Core Question

**"How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"**

- Very disappointed
- Somewhat disappointed
- Not disappointed
- N/A - I no longer use [product]

## The PMF Benchmark

**40% Rule:**
> If at least 40% of users say they'd be "very disappointed" without your product, you have product-market fit.

**Origin:** Sean Ellis surveyed multiple successful startups and found that those with >40% "very disappointed" consistently demonstrated strong PMF and growth.

**Interpretation:**
- **>40%:** You have PMF - focus on growth
- **25-40%:** Improving, but not there yet
- **<25%:** Weak PMF - major work needed

## The Full Survey

### Core Questions (Required)

1. **PMF Question:**
   "How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"

2. **Primary Benefit:**
   "What is the main benefit you receive from [product]?"

3. **User Type:**
   "What type of person do you think would most benefit from [product]?"
   [Open text field]

4. **Improvement:**
   "How can we improve [product] for you?"
   [Open text field]

5. **Alternative:**
   "What would you likely use as an alternative if [product] were no longer available?"
   [Open text field]

### Optional Demographics
- Role/title
- Company size
- Use case
- How they found you

## The Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Calculate Your PMF Score

Total "very disappointed" responses / Total valid responses = PMF %

**Example:**
- 100 responses
- 45 "very disappointed"
- 35 "somewhat disappointed"
- 15 "not disappointed"
- 5 "N/A - no longer use"

PMF Score = 45/95 = **47%** (exclude N/A responses)

### Step 2: Segment Your Users

Create three segments:

**1. High-Expectation Customers ("Very disappointed")**
- These are your core users
- They "get" your product
- They're getting value
- Focus: Build for them

**2. Middle-of-the-Road Customers ("Somewhat disappointed")**
- They see some value but not enough
- May have unmet needs
- Focus: Understand their objections

**3. Cold Customers ("Not disappointed")**
- Wrong audience or wrong product
- Focus: Ignore them (harsh but true)

### Step 3: Analyze by Segment

**For "Very Disappointed" Users:**

**Main Benefit Analysis:**
- What common benefits do they mention?
- This is your core value prop
- Double down on this

**User Type Analysis:**
- Who do they say would benefit?
- This defines your target market
- Focus acquisition here

**Example (Superhuman):**
"Email power users who get 100+ emails/day and need to process email fast"

**For "Somewhat Disappointed" Users:**

**Improvement Analysis:**
- What's missing for them?
- Are these requests aligned with your high-expectation customers?
  - **If YES:** Prioritize these improvements
  - **If NO:** These users aren't your target market

### Step 4: Build Your PMF Strategy

**The Roadmap:**

1. **Support high-expectation customers**
   - Build features they need
   - Double down on core value

2. **Convert somewhat disappointed users**
   - ONLY if their needs align with high-expectation customers
   - Build features that matter to both groups

3. **Acquire more high-expectation customers**
   - Target the persona defined by your "very disappointed" users
   - Use the benefits they mentioned in messaging

## When to Run the Survey

**Timing:**
- After users have experienced core value (not day 1)
- Minimum 2-4 weeks of usage
- When you have 30+ active users
- Repeat quarterly to track progress

**Who to Survey:**
- Active users (used in last 30 days)
- Users who've completed onboarding
- Users who've experienced your core loop

**Don't survey:**
- Brand new users (no opinion yet)
- Churned users (biased sample)
- Trial users who haven't activated

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Surveying too early** - Users need to experience value first
❌ **Trying to please everyone** - Focus on "very disappointed" users
❌ **Building for "somewhat" users whose needs don't align** - This dilutes your product
❌ **Ignoring the segmentation** - The average masks what matters
❌ **Only running once** - PMF evolves, measure regularly
❌ **Not following through** - Collecting data without acting on it

## How Superhuman Used This

**Initial State (2017):**
- PMF Score: 22%
- Below the 40% threshold
- Not ready to scale

**Analysis:**
- "Very disappointed" users: Email power users processing 100+ emails/day
- Main benefit: Speed ("get through email fast")
- Needed: Better keyboard shortcuts, faster search

**Actions:**
- Built features for power users
- Improved speed and shortcuts
- Targeted lookalike users in acquisition
- Delayed scaling until PMF improved

**Result (2019):**
- PMF Score: 58%
- Crossed 40% threshold
- Began scaling growth

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**Combines with:**
- **Brian Balfour's Four Fits** - Validates Market-Product fit
- **Teresa Torres' Discovery** - Guides what opportunities to pursue
- **Lenny's PMF Frameworks** - Additional PMF indicators

## Key Questions to Ask

### Before surveying:
- "Do we have enough active users to get signal?"
- "Have users experienced our core value proposition?"
- "Are we ready to act on the results?"

### After surveying:
- "What's our PMF score?"
- "Who are our 'very disappointed' users and what do they have in common?"
- "What benefits do they mention most?"
- "Do 'somewhat disappointed' users want things aligned with our core users?"
- "Should we change our target market based on who loves us?"

## Practical Example

**Product:** Project management tool for remote teams

**Survey Results (150 responses):**
- 30 "very disappointed" (21%)
- 70 "somewhat disappointed" (49%)
- 35 "not disappointed" (24%)
- 15 "N/A - no longer use"

**PMF Score: 30/135 = 22%** (below threshold)

**"Very Disappointed" Analysis:**
- **Main benefit:** "Async communication reduces meetings"
- **User type:** "Distributed engineering teams in different timezones"
- **Common traits:** 10+ person teams, 3+ timezones

**"Somewhat Disappointed" Analysis:**
- Split into two groups:
  - Group A: "Need better async features" (aligned!)
  - Group B: "Want Gantt charts and resource planning" (not aligned)

**Strategy:**
1. ✅ Target distributed engineering teams specifically
2. ✅ Double down on async communication features
3. ✅ Build features Group A requests (aligned)
4. ❌ Ignore Gantt chart requests (not aligned with core)
5. ✅ Adjust messaging to emphasize "reduce meetings"

**6 Months Later:**
- Focused acquisition on distributed eng teams
- Built better async features
- Resurveyed

**New PMF Score: 43%** ✅ Crossed threshold!
