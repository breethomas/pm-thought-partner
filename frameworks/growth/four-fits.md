# The Four Fits Framework

**Author:** Brian Balfour
**Category:** Growth
**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

Brian Balfour's Four Fits framework explains why some products grow and others don't. Growth isn't just about tactics - it requires alignment across four dimensions. When all four fits are present, growth compounds. When any fit is missing, growth stalls.

## The Four Fits

```
    Market ←→ Product
       ↕          ↕
    Model  ←→ Channel
```

All four must align with each other.

### 1. Market-Product Fit

**"Are you building something people want?"**

The foundation. You must solve a real problem for a defined market.

**Components:**
- **Target Market:** Specific segment with shared characteristics
- **Value Proposition:** Clear benefit that resonates
- **Product:** Solution that delivers the promise

**Signs of fit:**
- Organic word-of-mouth
- High retention rates
- Users can't imagine living without it
- "Very disappointed" score >40% (Rahul Vohra method)

**Signs of lack of fit:**
- High churn
- No organic growth
- Users don't engage consistently
- Can't articulate clear value

### 2. Product-Channel Fit

**"Does your product naturally fit a growth channel?"**

Your product characteristics must align with how you acquire users.

**Key insight:** Product determines channel, not the other way around.

**Examples:**

**Visual products** → Instagram, Pinterest (visual channels)
- Airbnb listings
- Design tools
- Fashion/home decor

**Professional products** → LinkedIn, cold outreach (professional channels)
- B2B SaaS
- Recruiting tools
- Enterprise software

**Viral mechanics** → Built-in sharing (viral channels)
- Dropbox (invite for storage)
- Loom (videos shared externally)
- Calendly (booking links)

**Search intent products** → SEO/SEM (search channels)
- "How to" tools
- Information products
- Transactional products

**Questions to assess:**
- "What channels do our target users naturally use?"
- "Does our product have built-in sharing mechanics?"
- "Is our product inherently visual/social/searchable?"
- "What channels align with how users discover solutions like ours?"

### 3. Channel-Model Fit

**"Can you acquire users profitably through this channel?"**

Your business model must support the cost of your channel.

**The Math:**
```
LTV (Lifetime Value) > CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) × 3

Payback Period < 12 months (ideally < 6)
```

**Examples:**

**High LTV products** → Can afford expensive channels
- Enterprise SaaS (multi-year contracts)
- Can use: Sales teams, conferences, outbound
- CAC: $10K+ acceptable

**Low LTV products** → Must use cheap channels
- Consumer apps ($5-10/month)
- Must use: Viral, SEO, product-led growth
- CAC: Must be < $50

**Mid-market products** → Balanced approach
- SMB SaaS ($50-500/month)
- Can use: Paid ads, content marketing, partnerships
- CAC: $500-2000

**Questions to assess:**
- "What can we afford to pay to acquire a customer?"
- "What's the payback period for this channel?"
- "Are we profitable at scale in this channel?"
- "Do unit economics improve or worsen as we scale?"

### 4. Model-Market Fit

**"Can you build a viable business in this market?"**

Market size and dynamics must support your business model.

**Components:**

**Market Size:**
- TAM (Total Addressable Market)
- Must be large enough for your growth goals
- Consider: Are you enterprise, SMB, or consumer?

**Market Dynamics:**
- How fragmented is the market?
- How much can customers pay?
- What's the sales cycle?
- How competitive is it?

**Examples:**

**Large market, low willingness to pay** → Volume business
- Consumer apps
- Freemium SaaS
- Must have low CAC, strong retention

**Small market, high willingness to pay** → High-touch sales
- Specialized enterprise software
- Can support expensive sales process
- Long sales cycles acceptable

**Questions to assess:**
- "Is this market big enough for our goals?"
- "What can customers in this market afford?"
- "What's the competitive intensity?"
- "Are there enough buyers to sustain growth?"

## How the Fits Interact

### All Four Must Align

**Example: Misalignment**

Product: Slack (team communication)
Market: Enterprises
Channel: Enterprise sales team
Model: $100K+ annual contracts

❌ **Product-Channel misfit:** Slack's viral, bottom-up adoption doesn't match enterprise sales motion

✅ **Fixed:** Slack uses product-led growth (free tier) with sales overlay for large accounts

### Getting to Four Fits

**Don't try to achieve all four at once.**

**Phase 1: Market-Product Fit First**
- Nothing else matters if people don't want it
- Get retention right
- Validate value proposition

**Phase 2: Find Product-Channel Fit**
- Identify channels that match your product
- Test multiple channels
- Double down on what shows signs of working

**Phase 3: Achieve Channel-Model Fit**
- Validate unit economics
- Ensure profitability at scale
- Optimize CAC and LTV

**Phase 4: Confirm Model-Market Fit**
- Ensure market can support your ambitions
- Validate market size
- Understand competitive dynamics

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Optimizing growth before Market-Product fit** - Amplifying something nobody wants
❌ **Choosing channel based on preference** - "I want to do content marketing" without fit assessment
❌ **Ignoring unit economics** - Growing unprofitably
❌ **Wrong channel for product type** - Enterprise sales for viral product
❌ **Assuming one model fits all markets** - Same pricing for SMB and Enterprise

## AI's Impact on Four Fits (2024-2025 Update)

Brian Balfour's recent thinking on how AI changes the framework:

### New Product-Channel Fits
- **AI products with embedded virality:** ChatGPT share links, Midjourney galleries
- **AI-generated content for SEO:** Automated content loops
- **Personalized channel optimization:** AI determines best channel per user

### Changed Channel Economics
- AI reduces CAC through better targeting
- AI chatbots reduce sales cost for mid-market
- Product-led growth enhanced by AI onboarding

### Market Expansion
- AI lowers barriers to entry (reduces need for specialists)
- New markets emerge for AI-native tools
- Traditional markets disrupted by AI alternatives

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**Combines well with:**
- **Elena Verna's Growth Loops** - Channel fit determines which loop to build
- **Rahul Vohra's PMF Survey** - Validates Market-Product fit
- **Unit Economics** - Essential for Channel-Model fit

## When to Use This Framework

- ✅ Planning your growth strategy
- ✅ Diagnosing why growth isn't working
- ✅ Choosing which channels to invest in
- ✅ Evaluating if your business model is sustainable
- ✅ Deciding between different market segments

## Practical Application

**Scenario: B2B SaaS project management tool**

**1. Market-Product Fit:**
- Target: Small creative agencies (10-50 people)
- Problem: Generic PM tools too complex
- Validation: 60% retention after 90 days, NPS 45

**2. Product-Channel Fit:**
- Product has:
  - Collaborative features (users invite teammates)
  - Beautiful UI (shareable)
  - Quick setup (low friction)
- Best channels:
  - Product-led growth (free tier)
  - LinkedIn (B2B audience)
  - Agency communities/forums

**3. Channel-Model Fit:**
- LTV: $3,000 (avg 2.5 year retention × $100/mo)
- Target CAC: $1,000 (3:1 LTV:CAC)
- PLG + content: Can acquire for $400-800
- ✅ Economics work

**4. Model-Market Fit:**
- TAM: 50,000 creative agencies in US
- Addressable: ~10,000 (those willing to pay $100/mo)
- Revenue potential: $12M ARR at 10% penetration
- ✅ Big enough for VC-backed growth

**Result:** All four fits align → Ready to scale growth

## Key Questions to Ask

**Diagnostic questions:**
- "Which of the four fits are we confident in?"
- "Where's the weakest link?"
- "Are we trying to force a channel that doesn't fit our product?"
- "Can our model support our channel costs?"

**Strategic questions:**
- "Should we change our product to fit a better channel?"
- "Should we change our target market to improve economics?"
- "Do we need a different business model for this market?"
