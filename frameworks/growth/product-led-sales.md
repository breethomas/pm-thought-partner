**When to use:** When adding sales motion to a product-led growth (PLG) product

## What is it?

Product-Led Sales (PLS) is a go-to-market strategy where end-user usage becomes the basis for pipeline creation, reversing the traditional sales model. Instead of sales closing contracts first and usage following, users discover value through self-serve first, and that engagement becomes the foundation for sales conversations.

This represents a fundamental shift in how B2B companies approach enterprise selling.

## The Problem It Solves

Traditional PLG companies hit a ceiling when they try to move upmarket to enterprise accounts. They face two challenges:
1. Self-serve alone doesn't close large enterprise deals
2. Adding traditional sales creates conflict with product-led motion

Product-Led Sales solves this by creating a hybrid model where product usage and sales reinforce each other rather than compete.

## The Framework

### When to Add Sales to PLG Motion

**Segment-Based Approach:**

| Segment | Motion |
|---------|---------|
| SMB | Remain self-serve |
| Mid-Market | Transition to Product-Led Sales |
| Enterprise | Hybrid: PLG entry + traditional sales |

**Readiness Indicators:**

Sales should engage when two conditions align:
1. **Product Qualified Account (PQA):** Account reaches usage signals indicating buying intent
2. **Product Qualified Lead (PQL):** Someone with buying power exists within that account

**The Disruption Opportunity:**

Companies like Figma and Miro are disrupting enterprise by entering through end-users first, even in traditionally sales-led segments. The key is finding buyers within your user base rather than cold prospecting.

### How to Add Sales to PLG Motion

**Three-Step Integration:**

#### Step 1: Optimize for Team Value

"Lead with a team use case, messaging, value, and plans. 'Team' plan with one user > 'Individual' plan."

**Actions:**
- Build features enabling collaboration and multi-user adoption
- Position product as team solution, not individual tool
- Create pricing that incentivizes team adoption
- Design onboarding for team use cases

**Why it matters:**
Individual users don't create enterprise pipeline. Teams do. Your product must be valuable at the team level to justify sales engagement.

#### Step 2: Establish PQA Framework

Create scoring (e.g., 1-100) combining:
- **Usage volume:** How much are they using the product?
- **Feature breadth:** Are they using core features?
- **Velocity:** Is usage accelerating?
- **Behavioral signals:** Inviting teammates, creating content, etc.

**Set engagement thresholds:**
- Accounts scoring 80+ become sales targets
- Accounts 60-79 get success team white-glove activation
- Accounts below 60 stay self-serve

**Why it matters:**
Without clear qualification, sales wastes time on accounts that aren't ready to buy, and product teams get blamed for "low-quality leads."

#### Step 3: Identify Decision-Makers

"Most self-serve users are not enterprise buyers...should be approached as partners to sales, not leads."

**Distinguish:**
- **End Users:** The people using your product daily
- **Enterprise Buyers:** People with purchasing authority (IT, procurement, department heads)

**Sales approach:**
- Partner with end users to find buyers
- Don't treat every signup as an opportunity
- Respect that users and buyers have different motivations

### The Product-Led Sales Model

**Core Philosophy:**

Traditional sales: Contract closure → Usage begins
Product-Led Sales: End-user usage → Contract closure

**Key Structural Changes:**

| Traditional SaaS | Product-Led Sales |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Sales owns pipeline creation | Product teams accountable for PQAs |
| Land ARR focus | Expansion ARR focus |
| Marketing drives demand | Marketing enables product & sales |
| 70%+ budget on sales/marketing | 60%+ budget on product/engineering |

**Expansion-Focused Selling:**

Initial contract values from PLS are smaller than traditional enterprise deals because accounts are acquired earlier in their problem lifecycle. Revenue growth comes primarily through expansion as customers adopt additional features and seats.

**This requires:**
- Sales compensation tied to expansion, not just land
- Longer-term thinking about account value
- Partnership between sales and success teams

### Hybrid PLG+Sales Strategies

**Account Journey Framework:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Does buyer exist in user base?             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ YES + Account is PQA-qualified              │
│ → Deploy sales for conversion              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ YES + Account lacks PQA status              │
│ → Success teams white-glove activation      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ NO buyer in user base                       │
│ → Deploy ABM and prospecting                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The key:**
Use product signals to determine the right motion for each account, rather than applying one-size-fits-all approach.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. The Lead Confusion Error

"A new user does not mean you have an MQL...many companies flood sales with freshly signed-up end-user 'opportunities.'"

**The problem:**
- Sales expects qualified leads
- Product sends every signup
- Sales wastes time, product gets blamed
- Relationship between teams breaks down

**The fix:**
- Only pass PQAs (accounts) to sales, not PQLs (individuals)
- Ensure accounts meet usage thresholds
- Identify buyers within accounts before sales engagement

### 2. Overselling at Land

**The problem:**
Aggressively closing large initial contracts with PLS accounts disrupts expansion trajectories. The model depends on growing alongside customers over time.

**The fix:**
- Accept smaller initial deals
- Focus on proving value
- Build expansion pipeline
- Optimize for lifetime value, not first contract

### 3. Misaligned Incentives

**The problem:**
Sales teams optimized for closing large initial deals will underperform in PLS environments designed for long-term account expansion and value realization.

**The fix:**
- Compensate sales on expansion ARR, not just land ARR
- Measure customer health and growth, not just close rates
- Create career paths that reward account development
- Align sales and success teams on shared metrics

### 4. Ignoring Buyer Personas

**The problem:**
Failing to identify which user personas have actual purchasing authority means sales engages the wrong stakeholders, reducing conversion likelihood.

**The fix:**
- Map user personas to buying power
- Identify economic buyers, champions, and influencers
- Create playbooks for each buyer type
- Train sales to work with end users to find buyers

## AI-Era Adaptation

Product-Led Sales is particularly relevant in the AI era:

**AI lowers barriers to entry:**
- More companies can offer self-serve trials
- Users expect to try before buying
- Traditional sales cycles feel slow compared to instant product access

**AI enables better scoring:**
- ML models can identify PQAs more accurately
- Predictive analytics show which accounts will expand
- Automated signals trigger sales at optimal times

**AI personalizes the experience:**
- Different onboarding for individual vs. team users
- Customized feature recommendations
- Automated expansion opportunities based on usage patterns

## Metrics to Track

### Product Team Metrics
- PQA creation rate (qualified accounts per month)
- Time to PQA (from signup to qualified status)
- % of accounts reaching PQA threshold
- Feature adoption by segment

### Sales Team Metrics
- PQA → closed customer conversion rate
- Time from PQA to close
- Expansion ARR (more important than land ARR)
- Customer health scores

### Shared Metrics
- Revenue per account (expansion focus)
- Logo retention
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
- Product Qualified Revenue (PQR)

## When to Use This Framework

Use Product-Led Sales when:
- You have a PLG product hitting enterprise ceiling
- Self-serve works for SMB but not mid-market/enterprise
- You need to add sales without killing product-led motion
- Your product has strong usage signals predicting buying intent
- You want to move upmarket while preserving PLG economics

Don't use Product-Led Sales when:
- Your product doesn't have self-serve capability
- Usage signals don't correlate with buying intent
- You're purely enterprise (traditional sales may be better)
- You can't score accounts objectively

## Practical Implementation Example

**Scenario:** Developer tool with 10,000 free users, want to add sales for mid-market

**Step 1: Define Team Value**
- Build collaboration features (shared workspaces, team permissions)
- Create "Team" plan with 5+ seats
- Messaging: "Better together" positioning

**Step 2: Build PQA Scoring**
```
PQA Score = (Usage Points × 0.4) + (Team Size × 0.3) + (Feature Adoption × 0.2) + (Velocity × 0.1)

Where:
- Usage: Weekly active use = 10pts, Daily = 20pts
- Team Size: 3-5 users = 15pts, 6-10 = 25pts, 11+ = 35pts
- Features: Core feature used = 15pts, Advanced features = 30pts
- Velocity: Growth rate week-over-week

Threshold: 70+ = PQA
```

**Step 3: Identify Buyers**
- Look for sign-ups with company email domains
- Check job titles (Engineering Manager, Director, VP)
- Track who invited teammates (champions)
- Map organizational structure

**Step 4: Sales Engagement**
- Sales reaches out to accounts scoring 70+
- Success team helps accounts scoring 50-69 reach PQA status
- Accounts below 50 stay pure self-serve

**Step 5: Expansion Focus**
- Initial deal: Team plan for 5 users
- Month 3: Expand to 10 users
- Month 6: Add advanced features
- Month 12: Department-wide rollout
