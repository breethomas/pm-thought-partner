# LNO Prioritization Framework

**Source:** Aakash Gupta (based on Shreyas Doshi's original framework)
**Collaborator:** Courtland Halbrook (VP of Product Management, FourKites)
**When to use:** Daily task prioritization and time management

## What is it?

The LNO Framework helps PMs classify and act on tasks as **Leverage (L)**, **Neutral (N)**, or **Overhead (O)**. This categorization enables better time allocation, prevents burnout, and maximizes impact by focusing energy where it compounds.

The framework recognizes that not all work deserves equal effort—and that's intentional.

## The Problem It Solves

Pre-LNO, typical PM to-do lists are cluttered with neutral and overhead tasks. PMs spread themselves thin trying to do everything perfectly, leading to:
- Burnout from treating all work equally
- Missed opportunities for strategic impact
- Time spent on low-value administrative work
- Inability to distinguish what actually moves the needle

## The Framework

### Leverage Tasks (10x Impact)

Tasks that **"10x your impact"** and deliver exponential value.

**Examples:**
- Product vision development
- Strategic planning and competitive analysis
- Foundational product decisions
- Roadmap strategy
- Customer insight development

**How to approach:**
- **"Be a perfectionist about it"**
- Continuously improve leverage work
- Pursue excellence and deep quality
- This is where you "move the world"

**Priority hierarchy for PMs:**
1. Vision and strategy (highest leverage)
2. Scoping work (medium leverage)
3. Execution details (lowest leverage)

### Neutral Tasks (Regular Impact)

Important work delivering **"regular impact in exchange for time"** but moving "in inches not miles."

**Examples:**
- Explaining vision to unimportant stakeholders
- Re-pitching information to cross-functional teams
- Unblocking engineers on execution details
- Stakeholder presentations
- Routine updates
- Execution support

**How to approach:**
- **"Do a strictly good job, no better"**
- Aim for C+/B- quality
- Avoid perfectionism
- Complete efficiently and move on

### Overhead Tasks (Minimal Impact)

Low-impact administrative work with minimal returns on time invested.

**Examples:**
- Project management and coordination
- Note-taking and status updates
- Spec recasting and template reformatting
- Jira ticket conversions
- Administrative paperwork
- Redundant reporting

**How to approach:**
- **"Actively try to do a bad job"**
- Complete quickly
- Minimize time investment
- Architect systems to eliminate this work entirely

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Identify High-Leverage Work

Ask yourself:
- What foundational work will compound over time?
- What decisions or strategies will influence everything downstream?
- What will still matter in 6 months? 12 months?

Prioritize by foundational importance, not urgency.

### Step 2: Assess Personal Context

Evaluate tasks based on your PM "shape" and strengths:
- If you're a **"People Manager"**: Spike on stakeholder management (your leverage area)
- If you're an **"Innovator"**: Focus on customer insights and design (your leverage area)
- If you're a **"Strategist"**: Double down on vision and competitive positioning

**Your leverage tasks are contextual to your strengths and role.**

### Step 3: Offload Lower-Leverage Work

Two methods to reduce neutral and overhead work:

**Method 1: Involve engineering early in strategy**
- Bring engineers into vision and strategy discussions
- They become more autonomous in execution decisions
- Reduces need for PM involvement in execution details

**Method 2: Empower teams to make decisions independently**
- Create frameworks teams can use without PM input
- Establish clear decision-making authority
- Trust teams to solve problems

### Step 4: Architect Away Overhead

The best PMs **"eliminate overhead work to zero"** through:
- Conversations with engineering managers and designers
- Establishing what the framework calls a "leveraged culture"
- Automating or delegating administrative tasks
- Creating systems that prevent overhead from being created

## Time Allocation Shift

**Before LNO:**
```
Leverage:  20%
Neutral:   50%
Overhead:  30%
```

**After LNO:**
```
Leverage:  60%
Neutral:   30%
Overhead:  10%
```

The key is spending less time on overhead and using that time for leverage activities, which compounds for PMs to have higher impact over long run.

## AI-Era Adaptation

The LNO Framework is even more critical in the AI era:

**Leverage becomes more leveraged:**
- AI tools let you prototype strategies in hours
- Strategic decisions compound faster
- Vision work can be tested immediately

**Overhead can be automated:**
- AI handles note-taking, status updates, formatting
- Template work becomes near-zero cost
- Administrative tasks can be delegated to AI assistants

**Focus shifts to judgment:**
- Neutral work (execution details) can often be handled by empowered teams + AI
- PM time should concentrate on leverage (vision, strategy, foundational decisions)

## Extended Version: LNOD

Some PMs add a fourth category:

**Don't (D):** Work colleagues expect but shouldn't consume PM time at all.
- Distractions that should be declined
- Requests that belong to other roles
- Work that doesn't align with outcomes

## Alternative: Eisenhower Matrix

For visually-oriented PMs, the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important 2x2) serves a similar purpose. However, LNO is more action-oriented:
- LNO tells you how much effort to apply
- Eisenhower tells you whether to do it

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Treating everything as leverage**
- Not everything is strategic; some work is genuinely overhead

❌ **Perfectionism on neutral tasks**
- "Good enough" is the goal; don't over-invest

❌ **Ignoring context**
- Leverage work depends on your role, strengths, and company stage

❌ **Not eliminating overhead**
- The goal isn't to do overhead faster—it's to eliminate it

❌ **Assuming the framework is universal**
- In delivery-focused organizations, execution may be your leverage work

## When to Use This Framework

Use LNO when:
- Your to-do list feels overwhelming
- You're unclear where to invest time
- You're doing everything at the same quality level
- You want to maximize long-term impact
- You need to justify saying "no" to low-value work

## Task Categorization Cheat Sheet

| Category | Time Investment | Quality Bar | Examples |
|----------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Leverage** | Maximum time, continuous refinement | Perfectionism | Vision, strategy, competitive analysis, roadmap priorities |
| **Neutral** | Sufficient time, no more | C+/B- quality | Stakeholder updates, execution support, routine presentations |
| **Overhead** | Minimal time | Just done | Templates, Jira admin, status reports, formatting |

## Critical Success Factor

**Context matters.** The framework assumes you can influence strategy and vision. In delivery-focused organizations where PMs are execution-focused, you may need to redefine what constitutes "high leverage" in your specific environment.

**The leverage/neutral/overhead categorization is contextual to:**
- Your role and seniority
- Your company's stage and needs
- Your unique strengths
- Your team's maturity

**Remember:** The best PMs don't try to do everything well—they identify leverage work and spike there while minimizing time on everything else.
