# Now-Next-Later Roadmap

**Author:** Janna Bastow
**Category:** Planning / Roadmapping
**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

The Now-Next-Later roadmap framework replaces traditional timeline-based Gantt chart roadmaps with an outcome-focused, time-horizon approach. Invented by Janna Bastow (co-founder of ProdPad and Mind the Product) in 2012, it acknowledges uncertainty and emphasizes learning over commitment.

## The Problem with Traditional Roadmaps

**Timeline/Gantt Chart Roadmaps:**
```
Q1          Q2          Q3          Q4
Feature A   Feature C   Feature E
Feature B   Feature D   Feature F
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Commits to dates too early
- ❌ Ignores uncertainty (things change!)
- ❌ Becomes a stakeholder commitment, not a plan
- ❌ Doesn't account for learning
- ❌ Teams feel locked in even when priorities shift

## The Now-Next-Later Framework

**Three time horizons based on certainty:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  NOW (High Certainty)                    │
│  - Currently being worked on             │
│  - Well-defined, in execution            │
│  - Next few weeks/sprints                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  NEXT (Medium Certainty)                 │
│  - Being validated and refined           │
│  - Up next after NOW items               │
│  - Next 1-3 months                       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LATER (Low Certainty)                   │
│  - Exploring and considering             │
│  - May or may not happen                 │
│  - 3+ months out, fuzzy future           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## The Cone of Uncertainty

**Origin:** The further out you plan, the less certain things become.

```
        High Certainty
            |
         NOW │
            |
            |    Medium Certainty
            │
          NEXT│
            |
            │       Low Certainty
            │
          LATER│
            │
            |
            ▼
```

**Key Insight:** Stop pretending you can predict the future. Embrace uncertainty.

## How to Use Now-Next-Later

### NOW Column

**What goes here:**
- Items in active development
- Well-defined features/initiatives
- Engineering is building it right now

**Characteristics:**
- High certainty it will ship
- Scope is clear
- Team is committed
- Typically 1-3 items max

**What to communicate:**
- "We're working on this now"
- "Expected to ship in the next few weeks"

### NEXT Column

**What goes here:**
- Items being validated
- Up next after NOW items complete
- Discovery work happening

**Characteristics:**
- Medium certainty (might change!)
- Requirements being refined
- Team is researching/designing
- Could have 3-5 items

**What to communicate:**
- "We're planning to work on this next"
- "Subject to change based on learning"
- "Actively doing discovery"

### LATER Column

**What goes here:**
- Ideas being explored
- Future considerations
- Items that might never happen

**Characteristics:**
- Low certainty
- Might get deprioritized
- Placeholder for "someday/maybe"
- Can have many items

**What to communicate:**
- "We're considering this"
- "No commitment yet"
- "Depends on how NOW and NEXT go"

## Movement Between Columns

**Healthy flow:**

```
LATER → NEXT → NOW → SHIPPED
        ↑       ↑       ↑
    (Validated) (Started) (Done)
```

**As items move:**
- LATER items get validated → Move to NEXT
- NEXT items get defined → Move to NOW
- NOW items get built → Move to SHIPPED
- Some LATER items → Get deprioritized/removed

## What to Include on Each Card

**Focus on outcomes, not features:**

**Bad (feature-focused):**
- "Add dark mode"
- "Build recommendation engine"
- "Integrate with Salesforce"

**Good (outcome-focused):**
- "Help users work comfortably at night → exploring dark mode"
- "Increase engagement through personalization → considering recommendation engine"
- "Enable sales teams to sync data → investigating Salesforce integration"

**Each card should have:**
- **Outcome:** What you're trying to achieve
- **Hypothesis:** Why you think this will work
- **Status:** Discovery, Design, Development
- **Evidence:** Research insights, data

## Key Benefits

✅ **Manages expectations** - No false date commitments
✅ **Embraces uncertainty** - Acknowledges things change
✅ **Enables flexibility** - Easy to reprioritize
✅ **Focuses on outcomes** - Not just shipping features
✅ **Reduces pressure** - Teams aren't locked into dates
✅ **Better stakeholder communication** - Honest about certainty

## Common Questions

### "But stakeholders want dates!"

**Answer:** Give them sequence and certainty level instead:
- "We're working on X now (high certainty, ships soon)"
- "Y is next (medium certainty, after X)"
- "Z is later (low certainty, depends on learning)"

This is often MORE useful than "Q3 2025" which becomes outdated.

### "How do I know what to put where?"

**Use these criteria:**

**NOW:**
- In active development?
- Scope locked?
- Team building it?

**NEXT:**
- Validated enough to commit soon?
- Discovery underway?
- Likely to start in 4-8 weeks?

**LATER:**
- Still exploring?
- Might get deprioritized?
- No timeline yet?

### "Can I have dates?"

**Optional approach:**
- NOW: "Shipping in next 2-4 weeks"
- NEXT: "Starting in next 1-3 months"
- LATER: "3+ months, TBD"

But avoid specific dates (no "March 15th").

## Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too many items in NOW** - Should be 1-3 max, actively in dev
❌ **Treating NEXT like a commitment** - It's a plan, not a promise
❌ **Not moving items backward** - If priorities change, move cards back to LATER
❌ **Getting too detailed in LATER** - It's fuzzy, keep it high-level
❌ **Using it like a timeline** - It's about sequence and certainty, not dates

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**Combines well with:**
- **Teresa Torres' Continuous Discovery** - Discovery moves items from LATER → NEXT
- **Marty Cagan's Four Risks** - Validate risks before moving to NOW
- **OKRs** - Map roadmap items to objectives

## Stakeholder Communication

**Executive update:**
```
NOW:
- Improving onboarding flow (shipping next week)
  → Increase activation rate

NEXT:
- Exploring mobile app (discovery underway)
  → Enable on-the-go usage

LATER:
- Considering integrations marketplace
  → Expand use cases
```

**What this communicates:**
- ✅ What's happening now (concrete)
- ✅ What's being validated (flexible)
- ✅ What's on the radar (exploratory)

No false commitments, no broken promises.

## Adapting for Different Timeframes

**Fast-moving startups:**
- NOW: This week
- NEXT: Next 2-4 weeks
- LATER: Beyond 1 month

**Larger companies:**
- NOW: This quarter
- NEXT: Next quarter
- LATER: 6+ months out

## AI Impact (2024-2025)

**How AI enhances Now-Next-Later:**
- AI can help prioritize LATER items based on data
- AI can surface patterns in customer feedback to populate roadmap
- AI can help draft outcome-focused roadmap cards
- AI can auto-update stakeholders on movement between columns

## When to Use This Framework

- ✅ Communicating roadmap to stakeholders
- ✅ Planning with high uncertainty
- ✅ Managing stakeholder expectations
- ✅ Prioritizing with flexibility
- ✅ Avoiding false date commitments

## Practical Example

**Product:** B2B SaaS analytics tool

**NOW:**
- "Enable teams to share dashboards externally"
  - Status: In development
  - Why: Top customer request, enables sales use case
  - Ships: Next 2 weeks

**NEXT:**
- "Help users discover insights faster"
  - Exploring: AI-powered anomaly detection
  - Status: In discovery, prototyping
  - Why: Users miss important trends
  - Timeline: Start development in 4-6 weeks

- "Expand data source integrations"
  - Considering: Which sources to add
  - Status: Researching customer needs
  - Why: Customers use multiple tools
  - Timeline: After insights feature

**LATER:**
- "Mobile app for monitoring on-the-go"
  - Status: Idea stage
  - Why: Some users want mobile access
  - Open question: Is this high enough priority?

- "White-label solution for agencies"
  - Status: Exploring business model
  - Why: Potential new customer segment
  - Open question: Does this fit our strategy?

**Movement over time:**
- Insights feature moves from NEXT → NOW when discovery completes
- Mobile app might get deprioritized if data doesn't support it
- New items added to LATER based on customer conversations
