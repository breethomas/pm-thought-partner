# Frontier of Understanding Framework

**Source:** Ravi Mehta (Outpace, former CPO Tinder, Product Director Facebook, VP TripAdvisor)
**When to use:** Goal-setting, especially as an alternative to traditional OKRs

## What is it?

The Frontier of Understanding represents the boundary between what a team confidently knows how to execute versus what remains uncertain or risky. Rather than applying uniform goal-setting approaches, teams should strategically position goals at this frontier to drive meaningful progress.

The framework challenges conventional wisdom that outcome-based goals always outperform output-based goals. Instead, it emphasizes: **"The right goal depends on the team's understanding of what it is trying to accomplish."**

## The Problem It Solves

Traditional OKRs emphasize outcome metrics and aim for 50-70% achievement rates, which creates:
- **Confusion** about what will actually be delivered
- **Probabilistic planning** rather than deterministic commitments
- **Assumptions** that teams will "figure out" execution during the quarter
- **Misalignment** between goals and team readiness
- **Vicious cycle** of repeated goal misses that erode team credibility

The Frontier framework addresses this by acknowledging that different risk stages require different goal types—sometimes outputs must precede outcomes.

## The Framework

Teams progress through four sequential maturity stages as they advance toward business impact:

### 1. Understanding Risk

**When to use:** Your team doesn't know what actually drives the metric

**Focus:** Acquiring missing information to shape strategy

**Goal Type:** Research and discovery commitments

**Example:**
- ✅ "Identify the levers most likely to drive new user retention"
- ❌ "Increase new user retention by 5%" (too early—you don't know how yet)

**Rationale:** Before executing solutions, teams must validate assumptions about what actually moves the needle. Setting outcome goals here leads to random experimentation without learning.

### 2. Dependency Risk

**When to use:** Your team knows the strategy but lacks required resources/capabilities

**Focus:** Proving resource and capability readiness

**Goal Type:** Validation and infrastructure commitments

**Example:**
- ✅ "Validate that our experimentation platform will support new user retention experiments"
- ❌ "Launch 4 retention experiments" (too early—you can't run them yet)

**Rationale:** Execution fails when teams lack adequate tools, talent, or technical foundations. Prove you have what you need before committing to building.

### 3. Execution Risk

**When to use:** Your team knows what to build but hasn't proven you can deliver

**Focus:** Demonstrating effective operational delivery

**Goal Type:** Output-based commitments emphasizing delivery

**Example:**
- ✅ "Launch 4 new user retention experiments"
- ❌ "Increase retention by 5%" (too early—you haven't validated solutions work)

**Rationale:** Teams must prove they can reliably build and ship once strategy is clear. Output goals build credibility and demonstrate execution capability.

### 4. Strategic Risk

**When to use:** Your team can execute but needs to validate the strategy delivers impact

**Focus:** Validating that strategy generates intended business results

**Goal Type:** Outcome-based commitments tied to business metrics

**Example:**
- ✅ "Increase new user retention by 5% based on top performing experiments"
- ❌ "Launch 10 more experiments" (you've proven execution; now prove impact)

**Rationale:** Outcomes demonstrate whether the chosen direction actually moves business results. This is the appropriate time for metric-based goals.

## Setting Goals at the Frontier

The framework operates on a spectrum between overconfidence and excessive risk:

```
[Confidence Zone] ←→ [Frontier of Understanding] ←→ [Uncertainty Zone]
     Too Safe              Optimal                    Too Risky
```

**Too Safe (Confidence Zone):**
- Goals your team already knows how to achieve
- No learning opportunity
- No advancement of capabilities
- Wastes team potential

**Optimal (Frontier):**
- Goals that challenge teams to advance
- Believable but ambitious
- Require new learning or capability development
- Maintain achievability

**Too Risky (Uncertainty Zone):**
- Goals in territory teams don't understand
- Frequent failures
- Erodes team agency and confidence
- Feels random rather than strategic

**Key Question:** "Where is my frontier of understanding and what goals will help me move that frontier closer to the outcome?"

## Progression Path

The framework enables progression toward ambitious outcomes through believable intermediate milestones:

```
Understanding Risk → Dependency Risk → Execution Risk → Strategic Risk → Outcome Achievement
```

Rather than attempting dramatic leaps from understanding to outcomes, teams advance systematically through each stage.

## AI-Era Adaptation

The Frontier of Understanding is particularly valuable in the AI era:

**Faster progression through stages:**
- AI tools let you prototype quickly, reducing understanding risk
- Infrastructure setup is faster (cloud platforms, AI-powered dev tools)
- You can move from understanding → execution → outcomes in weeks, not quarters

**More frequent recalibration:**
- AI changes markets and user expectations rapidly
- Teams may regress from Strategic Risk back to Understanding Risk as conditions shift
- Continuous assessment of "where is our frontier now?" becomes critical

**New risk: Model Risk:**
- For AI products, add a layer: "Does our model perform well enough?"
- This sits between Execution Risk and Strategic Risk

## How to Apply It

### Step 1: Diagnose Your Current Stage

Ask your team:
- "Do we understand what drives this metric?" (Understanding Risk)
- "Do we have the tools/talent/infrastructure?" (Dependency Risk)
- "Can we reliably execute our strategy?" (Execution Risk)
- "Do we know if our strategy actually works?" (Strategic Risk)

### Step 2: Set Goals at the Frontier

Match your goal type to your stage:
- Understanding Risk → Discovery goals
- Dependency Risk → Infrastructure goals
- Execution Risk → Output goals
- Strategic Risk → Outcome goals

### Step 3: Create Believable Path

Map the progression:
1. What would move us from Understanding → Dependency?
2. What would move us from Dependency → Execution?
3. What would move us from Execution → Strategic?
4. What outcome would prove our strategy works?

### Step 4: Communicate the Sequence

Help stakeholders understand:
- "We're currently at [stage]"
- "This quarter we're moving to [next stage]"
- "That's why our goal is [goal type] rather than [different type]"

## Using with OKRs

If your organization requires OKRs, adapt the framework:

**Add task lists:**
- Identify required work and validate feasibility
- Make implicit assumptions explicit

**Include qualitative key results:**
- "Complete discovery research identifying top 3 retention levers" (Understanding Risk)
- "Validate experimentation platform can support A/B tests" (Dependency Risk)

**Pressure-test key results:**
- Do they address your current frontier?
- Or are they jumping ahead to outcomes you can't confidently achieve?

## When to Use This Framework

Use Frontier of Understanding when:
- Your team repeatedly misses outcome-based goals
- Stakeholders push for metrics before you understand the problem
- You need to justify why you're setting output goals instead of outcome goals
- You're in a new problem space and need to build toward outcomes systematically
- Traditional OKRs feel arbitrary or disconnected from reality

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Skipping stages**
- Jumping from Understanding Risk to Strategic Risk without proving execution

❌ **Staying too long in early stages**
- Using "we need more research" to avoid accountability

❌ **Setting uniform goal types**
- Assuming all teams should use outcome goals regardless of stage

❌ **Ignoring regression**
- Markets and technology shift; teams can move backward through stages

❌ **Confusing confidence with certainty**
- The frontier moves; you're never 100% certain

## Framework Benefits

**Builds credibility:**
- Achievable-yet-ambitious commitments
- Teams deliver what they promise

**Creates early signals:**
- Know when you're drifting off track before quarter ends

**Establishes progression:**
- Clear path to strategic outcomes
- Feels both possible and impactful

**Empowers teams:**
- "Masters of their destiny" rather than passive goal recipients
- Agency through appropriate challenges
