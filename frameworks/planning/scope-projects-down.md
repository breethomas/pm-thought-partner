# Scope Projects Down

**Source:** Linear Method
**Category:** Planning & Execution
**Best for:** Breaking down large initiatives, shipping continuously, maintaining momentum

## Core Principle

**Design projects to take 1-3 weeks with 1-3 people.**

This constraint forces you to scope down to what truly matters and ship value continuously rather than waiting months for a "big launch."

## Why This Matters

**The Problem:**
- Large projects drag on for months
- Scope creep kills momentum
- Feedback comes too late to matter
- Teams lose focus and energy

**The Solution:**
Small, tightly scoped projects create:
- Quick feedback loops
- Clear priorities (what can we cut?)
- Continuous shipping
- Sustained team velocity

## The Framework

### 1. Start With the Constraint

**When planning any initiative, ask:**
- Can this be built by 1-3 people in 1-3 weeks?
- If not, what's the smallest version that delivers value?

**This forces hard prioritization decisions upfront.**

### 2. Break Large Work Into Stages

Don't scope down by building features halfway. Instead, **ship complete stages sequentially.**

**Example from Linear:**
Linear wanted to ship project management capabilities. Instead of building everything at once, they broke it into stages:

1. **Cycles** (2 weeks) - Time-based planning
2. **Projects** (2 weeks) - Cross-cycle initiatives
3. **Roadmaps** (later) - Visual planning layer

Each stage was fully functional and valuable on its own.

### 3. Optimize for Learning Speed

**The goal isn't to ship fast—it's to learn fast.**

Small projects = faster feedback = better decisions on what to build next.

**Ask:**
- What's the fastest way to test our core assumption?
- What can we learn in 2 weeks that informs the next stage?

### 4. Protect Scope Ruthlessly

**Common scope creep patterns:**
- "While we're at it, let's add..."
- "We should really support [edge case]"
- "The design would be better if..."

**Your defense:**
- Can this wait for the next project?
- Does this block core value delivery?
- Will we learn something critical from shipping without this?

## How to Apply This

### For a New Feature

**Instead of:**
"Build AI recommendation engine" (3 months, whole team)

**Scope down to:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Simple collaborative filtering on existing data
2. **Week 3-4:** A/B test and measure engagement
3. **Week 5-6:** Add ML model if simple version proves valuable

### For Platform/Infrastructure

**Instead of:**
"Rebuild our API" (6 months)

**Scope down to:**
1. **Week 1-2:** New auth endpoints (most critical)
2. **Week 3-4:** Migrate one high-traffic feature
3. **Week 5-6:** Create migration tooling for remaining endpoints

### For Research/Discovery

**Instead of:**
"User research on mobile experience" (ongoing)

**Scope down to:**
1. **Week 1:** 10 customer interviews on specific pain point
2. **Week 2:** Test paper prototype with 5 users
3. **Week 3:** Validate solution approach with clickable prototype

## Warning Signs You Need to Scope Down

- **No one can explain the project in one sentence**
- **"We'll know more as we go"** - indicates too much uncertainty
- **Multiple teams need to coordinate** - unless they're all small sub-projects
- **More than 3 engineers required** - break it into stages
- **Timeline is "2-3 months"** - what can ship in week 1-3?

## AI-Era Adaptation

**With AI tooling, your 1-3 week constraint can deliver even more:**

- Prototype in hours/days, not weeks
- Test multiple approaches in parallel
- Use AI to handle "nice to have" features that would've been cut
- Focus human time on core value prop

**But the principle remains:** Small, focused projects ship faster and learn faster than large ones.

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Design for 1-3 weeks with 1-3 people**
✅ **Break large work into complete stages, not half-built features**
✅ **Optimize for learning speed, not feature completeness**
✅ **Protect scope ruthlessly—most "must-haves" can wait**

**Bottom line:** If you can't explain how to ship value in 2 weeks, you haven't scoped down enough.
