# Continuous Discovery Habits

## Overview

Continuous discovery is the practice of regularly engaging with customers to discover opportunities and test ideas, rather than treating discovery as a one-time upfront phase. Teresa Torres advocates for weekly touchpoints with customers to inform product decisions.

## Core Principle

> "At a minimum, weekly touchpoints with customers by the team building the product, where they conduct small research activities in pursuit of a desired outcome." - Teresa Torres

## The Framework

### 1. Start with Desired Outcomes
- Define clear business outcomes you're trying to achieve
- Outcomes should be measurable and time-bound
- Example: "Increase activation rate from 40% to 60% in Q2"

### 2. Map Opportunities
- Opportunities are customer needs, pain points, or desires
- Discovered through continuous customer conversations
- Organized visually in an Opportunity Solution Tree

### 3. Generate Solutions
- Multiple solutions for each opportunity
- Avoid falling in love with the first idea
- Compare and contrast different approaches

### 4. Run Experiments
- Test assumptions before building
- Start with smallest possible tests
- Learn quickly and iterate

## Opportunity Solution Tree (OST)

A visual framework that connects:
- **Desired Outcome** (top) - What you're trying to achieve
- **Opportunities** (middle layer) - Customer needs/problems
- **Solutions** (next layer) - Possible ways to address opportunities
- **Experiments** (bottom) - How you'll test solutions

```
                    Outcome
                       |
        +--------------+--------------+
        |              |              |
   Opportunity 1  Opportunity 2  Opportunity 3
        |              |              |
    +---+---+      +---+---+      +---+---+
    |   |   |      |   |   |      |   |   |
   S1  S2  S3     S4  S5  S6     S7  S8  S9
    |   |   |      |   |   |      |   |   |
   E1  E2  E3     E4  E5  E6     E7  E8  E9

S = Solutions, E = Experiments
```

## Weekly Cadence

**Minimum viable continuous discovery:**
- 1-2 hours per week with customers
- Whole product team participates
- Focus on learning, not selling or support
- Document insights immediately

## Types of Research Activities

### Discovery interviews
- Understand customer context and problems
- "Tell me about the last time you..."
- Focus on stories, not hypotheticals

### Assumption testing
- Identify riskiest assumptions
- Design quick tests
- Story-based or prototype testing

### Usability testing
- Test solutions with customers
- Observe, don't guide
- Focus on behavior, not opinions

## Key Questions to Ask

1. **Outcome clarity:**
   - "What metric are we trying to move?"
   - "How will we know if we're successful?"

2. **Opportunity exploration:**
   - "What customer problems have we discovered?"
   - "Which opportunities are we prioritizing and why?"

3. **Solution generation:**
   - "What are 3-5 different ways we could solve this?"
   - "What are we assuming must be true?"

4. **Experiment design:**
   - "What's the riskiest assumption?"
   - "What's the smallest test we can run?"

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Waiting until you've built something** - Discovery should happen before and during development
❌ **Only talking to customers once** - One-time research creates point-in-time snapshots
❌ **Letting research specialists do all the discovery** - The team building must be involved
❌ **Confusing customer requests with opportunities** - Dig deeper to understand the underlying need
❌ **Generating only one solution** - Explore multiple approaches before committing

## When to Use This Framework

- ✅ You're exploring what to build next
- ✅ You need to understand customer problems better
- ✅ You want to de-risk product decisions
- ✅ You're prioritizing between multiple opportunities
- ✅ Your team debates solutions without customer input

## Application Example

**Scenario:** You want to improve onboarding for a SaaS product

**Outcome:** Increase activation rate (users completing setup) from 40% to 60%

**Discovery Process:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Interview 6-8 recent signups about their onboarding experience
2. **Map Opportunities:**
   - "I didn't understand what to do first"
   - "I wanted to see value before investing time"
   - "I got distracted and never came back"
3. **Generate Solutions:** For "didn't understand what to do first":
   - Interactive product tour
   - Clear checklist widget
   - AI-powered setup assistant
   - Video walkthrough
4. **Design Experiments:**
   - Show mockups to users, ask them to narrate what they'd do
   - A/B test checklist vs. tour with 5% of traffic
   - Track completion and time-to-value

**Result:** Test before building, learn what resonates, iterate quickly
