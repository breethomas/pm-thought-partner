# The Four Big Risks

**Author:** Marty Cagan
**Category:** Discovery
**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

Marty Cagan's framework identifies four critical risks that every product idea faces. Product discovery is fundamentally about addressing these risks before building and shipping a product.

## The Four Risks

### 1. Value Risk
**"Will customers buy this or choose to use it?"**

- Most fundamental risk
- Does this actually solve a real problem?
- Would customers pay for it (or use it if free)?
- Is it significantly better than alternatives?

**How to address:**
- Customer discovery interviews
- Problem validation
- Demand testing
- Prototype testing with target users

### 2. Usability Risk
**"Can users figure out how to use it?"**

- Can users understand the product?
- Can they accomplish their goals efficiently?
- Is the UX intuitive for your target audience?

**How to address:**
- Usability testing with prototypes
- User testing sessions
- Observation of users attempting tasks
- A/B testing different approaches

### 3. Feasibility Risk
**"Can we build this with the time, skills, and technology we have?"**

- Technical capability and constraints
- Timeline and resources required
- Dependencies on other systems or teams
- Performance, scale, and reliability concerns

**How to address:**
- Technical spike work
- Proof-of-concept prototypes
- Engineering feasibility reviews
- Architecture discussions

### 4. Business Viability Risk
**"Does this solution work for our business?"**

- Does it fit our business model?
- Can we support/maintain it?
- Does it comply with legal/regulatory requirements?
- Does it align with our brand and strategy?
- Is it viable from sales, marketing, finance, legal perspectives?

**How to address:**
- Stakeholder reviews
- Business case analysis
- Legal/compliance review
- Financial modeling

## Key Principles

### 1. Address Risks Before Building
Don't wait until after launch to discover problems. Discovery is about quickly and cheaply testing ideas.

### 2. Value Risk is Usually Highest
Most product failures are because no one wanted it, not because it was hard to build or use.

### 3. Test with Real Target Users
Your team's opinions don't count. Test with actual customers in your target market.

### 4. Use Prototypes, Not Production Code
Test ideas with high-fidelity prototypes that require minimal engineering time.

## Discovery Techniques by Risk Type

### For Value Risk:
- Customer discovery interviews
- Concierge tests (manual delivery)
- Landing page tests
- Fake door tests
- Wizard of Oz tests

### For Usability Risk:
- Prototype testing
- Usability testing sessions
- Cognitive walkthroughs
- Task analysis

### For Feasibility Risk:
- Technical spikes
- Proof-of-concept code
- Architecture reviews
- Reference projects

### For Business Viability Risk:
- Stakeholder reviews
- Business model canvas
- Unit economics analysis
- Legal reviews

## Questions to Ask

### Assessing Value Risk:
- "What problem does this solve for customers?"
- "How do they solve this problem today?"
- "Would they pay for a better solution?"
- "What evidence do we have that customers want this?"
- "What would make them switch from their current solution?"

### Assessing Usability Risk:
- "Can target users complete key tasks without help?"
- "What are the most common points of confusion?"
- "Is the learning curve acceptable for our market?"
- "Does this work for our least tech-savvy users?"

### Assessing Feasibility Risk:
- "What's the hardest technical challenge here?"
- "What could block us from delivering this?"
- "Are there dependencies on other teams?"
- "What would we need to learn or build that's new?"
- "What performance/scale concerns exist?"

### Assessing Business Viability Risk:
- "Does this fit our business model?"
- "Can sales sell it? Can marketing market it?"
- "What are the support implications?"
- "Are there legal/regulatory issues?"
- "Does this align with company strategy?"

## Common Patterns

**Early-stage products:** Value risk is highest - focus there first
**Mature products:** Usability and business viability often more important
**Technical products:** Feasibility risk may be higher than usual
**Regulated industries:** Business viability (compliance) is critical

## Integration with Other Frameworks

Works well with:
- **Teresa Torres' Continuous Discovery** - Use four risks to prioritize what to test
- **Assumption Mapping** - Categorize assumptions by risk type
- **Lean Startup** - Four risks inform what experiments to run

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Building first, testing later** - Most expensive way to address risks
❌ **Assuming you are the user** - Your opinion on usability doesn't count
❌ **Ignoring business viability** - Engineering can build it but business can't support it
❌ **Only testing one risk** - All four must be addressed
❌ **Testing with the wrong users** - Must be target customers, not friends/family

## When to Use This Framework

- ✅ Evaluating new product ideas
- ✅ Planning discovery activities
- ✅ Prioritizing what to test first
- ✅ Deciding if you're ready to build
- ✅ Conducting pre-mortems on ideas

## Practical Application

**Example: Building a mobile app for restaurant reservations**

1. **Value Risk (Highest):**
   - Test: Show prototype to diners and restaurant owners
   - Question: Would diners actually use this vs. calling? Would restaurants adopt it?
   - Method: Concierge test - manually handle reservations for 3 restaurants

2. **Usability Risk:**
   - Test: Can users complete a reservation in 60 seconds?
   - Method: Prototype testing with 10 target users

3. **Feasibility Risk:**
   - Test: Can we integrate with existing restaurant systems?
   - Method: Technical spike with 2 different POS systems

4. **Business Viability Risk:**
   - Test: Will restaurants pay our commission? Can we scale customer support?
   - Method: Financial modeling + discussions with restaurant owners

**Order of testing:** Value → Usability → Feasibility → Business Viability

No point testing usability if no one wants it. No point building if it's not viable.
