# Ideas

This directory contains explorations of potential future directions for PM Thought Partner. These are not commitments or planned featuresâ€”they're ideas to explore, discuss, and evolve.

## Purpose

This is a space for:
- **Exploring possibilities** without commitment to implementation
- **Community discussion** about what could make PM Thought Partner more valuable
- **Capturing thinking** about PM frameworks and approaches that might be useful
- **Experimentation** with concepts before they become slash commands

## How to Engage

### If you have thoughts on an idea:
- Open an issue referencing the idea file
- Submit a PR to improve or expand the idea document
- Share how you'd use it or why it wouldn't work for you

### If you have your own idea:
1. Check existing ideas to see if it's related to something already here
2. Open an issue to discuss it first, or
3. Submit a PR with a new idea file using the `TEMPLATE.md` structure

## Status of Ideas

Ideas here are at various stages of development:
- Some are rough concepts that need fleshing out
- Some are well-developed but not yet validated
- Some might never be implemented
- Some might inform future commands or features

The presence of an idea here doesn't mean it will be built. It means it's worth thinking about.
