I need help measuring product-market fit using Rahul Vohra's PMF survey methodology (the Superhuman framework).

FRAMEWORK CONTEXT:

Rahul Vohra (CEO of Superhuman) developed a quantitative framework for measuring and improving product-market fit.

THE CORE QUESTION:
"How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"
- Very disappointed
- Somewhat disappointed
- Not disappointed
- N/A - I no longer use [product]

THE PMF BENCHMARK (40% Rule):
If at least 40% of users say they'd be "very disappointed" without your product, you have product-market fit.

Interpretation:
- >40%: You have PMF - focus on growth
- 25-40%: Improving, but not there yet
- <25%: Weak PMF - major work needed

THE FULL SURVEY (5 Core Questions):

1. PMF Question: "How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"
2. Primary Benefit: "What is the main benefit you receive from [product]?" [Open text]
3. User Type: "What type of person do you think would most benefit from [product]?" [Open text]
4. Improvement: "How can we improve [product] for you?" [Open text]
5. Alternative: "What would you likely use as an alternative if [product] were no longer available?" [Open text]

THE ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

Step 1: Calculate PMF Score
Total "very disappointed" / Total valid responses (exclude N/A) = PMF %

Step 2: Segment Users

1. High-Expectation Customers ("Very disappointed")
   - Your core users who "get" your product
   - Focus: Build for them

2. Middle-of-the-Road ("Somewhat disappointed")
   - See some value but not enough
   - Focus: Understand their objections

3. Cold Customers ("Not disappointed")
   - Wrong audience or wrong product
   - Focus: Ignore them

Step 3: Analyze by Segment

For "Very Disappointed" Users:
- Main Benefit Analysis: What common benefits do they mention?
- User Type Analysis: Who do they say would benefit most?
- Double down on these patterns

For "Somewhat Disappointed" Users:
- Improvement Requests: What's missing?
- Alternative Analysis: What are they comparing you to?
- Could you serve them better, or are they wrong fit?

Step 4: Roadmap Based on Insights

Priority 1: Reinforce what "very disappointed" users love
Priority 2: Address gaps preventing "somewhat" from becoming "very"
Priority 3: Communicate better to attract more high-expectation customers

KEY PRINCIPLES:

1. Segment and focus - Not all users are equal
2. High-expectation customers guide roadmap - Build for people who love you
3. Improve PMF before scaling - Don't pour gas on a weak fire
4. Run quarterly - PMF changes as product evolves
5. Don't just measure, act - Use insights to guide product decisions

SUPERHUMAN'S JOURNEY:
- Started at 22% "very disappointed"
- Focused exclusively on high-expectation customers
- Grew to 58% over time
- Used survey insights to guide every product decision
