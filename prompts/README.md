# Prompt Library

**For PMs using Claude.ai in the browser who want quick access to frameworks without setting up a full Project.**

## How to Use These Prompts

1. Browse the prompts below or in individual files
2. Copy the entire prompt (includes framework context + instructions)
3. Paste into any Claude conversation at claude.ai
4. Claude will respond using the specific framework

**Each prompt includes:**

- Specific instructions for application
- Key questions to ask
- Integration with other frameworks

## Tips for Using Prompts

### 1. Start Fresh

For best results, start a new conversation when using a prompt. This ensures Claude focuses on the framework you're using.

### 2. Add Your Context

After pasting the prompt, immediately add details about your situation:
- Product stage (0-1, PMF, growth, scale)
- Product type (B2B SaaS, consumer, AI product, marketplace)
- Specific challenge you're facing

**Example:**
> [Paste PMF survey prompt]
>
> Context: We're a B2B SaaS company with 50 paying customers, $50K MRR, 80% month-over-month retention. We think we have PMF but want to validate.

### 3. Ask Follow-up Questions

Have a conversation, don't stop after one response:
- "Why is that the right approach?"
- "What are the risks?"
- "Can you show me an example?"
- "How does this connect to [other framework]?"

### 4. Combine Frameworks

Reference multiple prompts in one conversation:
- "Now apply the Four Fits to validate this strategy"
- "How does continuous discovery help me test this?"
- "What growth loops could emerge from this?"

## Limitations vs. Full Skill

**What works with prompts:**
- ‚úÖ Full framework context and guidance
- ‚úÖ Strategic thinking and application
- ‚úÖ Integration with other frameworks

**What doesn't work:**
- ‚ùå Claude won't automatically remember frameworks across conversations
- ‚ùå You need to paste context each time (vs. Projects which remember)
- ‚ùå Can't access all frameworks simultaneously

**Solution:** For ongoing PM work, consider setting up a [Claude Project](../CLAUDE_PROJECTS_GUIDE.md) instead.

## Creating Your Own Prompts

Want to create a custom prompt for a specific framework?

**Template:**
```
I need help with [specific challenge] using [framework name] from [thought leader].

Framework context:
[Copy relevant sections from the framework file in /frameworks/]

My situation:
[Your specific context]

Help me:
1. Apply this framework to my situation
2. Challenge my assumptions
3. Identify what I'm missing
4. Create a concrete next step
```

## Staying Updated

New prompts are added as the PM Thought Partner evolves:
- ‚≠ê Star the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/breethomas/pm-thought-partner) for updates
- üëÄ Watch for new releases
- üì¨ Check back periodically for new frameworks

**Prefer a more permanent setup?** See the [Claude Projects Guide](../CLAUDE_PROJECTS_GUIDE.md) to create a persistent PM thought partner that remembers everything.
