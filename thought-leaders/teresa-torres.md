# Teresa Torres

**Focus:** Continuous Discovery, Customer-Centric Product Development

**Why She Matters:** Teresa transformed how product teams do discovery - from big upfront research phases to continuous, weekly customer engagement.

---

## Core Philosophy

**"At a minimum, weekly touchpoints with customers by the team building the product."**

Product teams should continuously engage with customers to discover opportunities and test ideas, not treat discovery as a one-time phase before building.

## Key Frameworks

### Continuous Discovery Habits
Weekly customer interviews by the product team (not just researchers).
Focus on learning, not selling or support.

**See:** `frameworks/discovery/continuous-discovery.md`

### Opportunity Solution Trees (OST)
Visual framework connecting:
- Outcome (what you're trying to achieve)
- Opportunities (customer needs/problems)
- Solutions (ways to address opportunities)
- Experiments (how to test solutions)

### Assumption Testing
Identify riskiest assumptions early.
Design quick, cheap tests.
Learn before building.

## What Makes Her Different

**Traditional approach:** Big research phase → Document insights → Build

**Teresa's approach:** Weekly customer conversations → Continuous learning → Build with evidence

**Key insight:** The team building the product should talk to customers, not delegate to researchers.

## Best For

- Learning how to structure discovery work
- Building customer interview habits
- Mapping opportunities systematically
- Testing assumptions before building
- Balancing discovery with delivery

## AI-Era Adaptation

Her frameworks work beautifully with modern speed:
- Weekly interviews still critical (maybe more so!)
- OST helps you choose between multiple prototype directions
- Assumption testing can happen in hours with prototypes
- Continuous discovery informs what to prototype next

## Quotes

> "The goal of discovery is to reduce risk, not to eliminate it."

> "We don't interview customers to ask them what to build. We interview them to understand their struggles."

> "Your job is not to build what customers ask for. It's to understand their needs well enough to design the right solution."

## When to Apply Her Thinking

- ✅ You're exploring what to build next
- ✅ You need to validate assumptions
- ✅ You want to build customer interview habits
- ✅ You're prioritizing between opportunities
- ✅ Your team debates without customer input

## Practical Tips from Teresa

1. **Start small**: One hour/week with customers beats quarterly big research
2. **Involve the team**: PMs, designers, engineers all join interviews
3. **Focus on stories**: "Tell me about the last time you..." not hypotheticals
4. **Map visually**: OST helps team align on opportunities
5. **Test assumptions**: Build experiment habit before committing to solutions

- **Prototype-First** - Discovery informs what to prototype
- **Lean Startup** - Continuous discovery feeds build-measure-learn

## Common Misunderstandings

❌ "Continuous discovery means never shipping" - Wrong. It informs what to ship.

❌ "We need dedicated researchers" - Wrong. Product team does the discovery.

❌ "Weekly interviews take too much time" - 1-2 hours/week is less time than building the wrong thing.

❌ "We already know what customers want" - You probably don't. Talk to them.

## Teresa's Evolution

**Early work (2010s):** Focused on lean UX and discovery practices

**Recent focus (2020s+):** Continuous discovery as team habit, OST framework refinement

**On AI:** Hasn't focused heavily on AI-specific topics, but her frameworks apply directly to AI product discovery

---

**Bottom line:** Teresa teaches you how to discover what to build by continuously engaging with customers.

Start with weekly customer conversations. Map opportunities. Test before building.
