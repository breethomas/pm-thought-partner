**Focus:** PM frameworks, visual communication, stakeholder management, AI prototyping

**Known For:** Visual frameworks on LinkedIn, "One Minute PM" newsletter, making PM concepts accessible

## Core Philosophy

Aakash Gupta believes complex PM concepts should be simple to understand and immediately actionable. Through visual frameworks and clear communication, he makes product management accessible to PMs at all levels.

His approach combines framework thinking with practical application - showing not just WHAT to do, but HOW to do it, with templates and examples you can use immediately.

## Key Contributions

### Visual Frameworks Library

**The approach:** Turn complex PM concepts into clear, visual frameworks that are:
- Easy to understand at a glance
- Shareable (LinkedIn carousels, Twitter threads)
- Immediately applicable
- Template-ready

**Popular frameworks:**
- Product strategy canvases
- Prioritization matrices
- Stakeholder mapping
- Communication frameworks
- Roadmapping approaches

**Why it works:** Visual > Text for understanding and retention. A good framework diagram beats a 10-page doc.

### Stakeholder Communication

**Core insight:** Most PM work is communication and influence, not just building products.

**Frameworks cover:**
- How to communicate up (executives)
- How to communicate across (peers, other functions)
- How to communicate down (team)
- Presentation structures
- Meeting frameworks
- Update formats

**Key principle:** Match communication style to audience. What executives need is different from what engineers need.

### AI Prototyping Tutorial

**Recent contribution:** Comprehensive guide to AI prototyping tools for PMs.

**Compared four major tools:**
- **v0 (Vercel):** Beautiful UI, pre-built components
- **Bolt:** Fastest iteration, browser-based
- **Replit:** Full-stack with DB and auth
- **Lovable:** Most accessible for non-technical PMs

**Key insight:** The modern PM workflow now includes prototyping at EVERY stage (ideation, design, scoping, handoff) - not just during one phase.

**See framework:** `/frameworks/ai-era-practices/prototype-first.md`

### Product Sense Development

**Focus:** Help PMs develop better product intuition.

**Content areas:**
- Product teardowns (analyzing successful products)
- Decision frameworks (how to make better product calls)
- Pattern recognition (what works in different contexts)
- Case studies (real examples with analysis)

**Approach:** Learn by studying what works, then apply patterns to your context.

## Core Principles

### 1. Make it Visual

"A framework people can see is more powerful than one they have to read."

Visual communication:
- Faster to understand
- Easier to remember
- More shareable
- Creates common language

### 2. Stakeholder Management is Core PM Work

"You don't build products alone. You build them through influence and communication."

Most PM work is actually:
- Aligning stakeholders
- Communicating strategy
- Managing expectations
- Building consensus

Product skills matter, but communication skills determine success.

### 3. Frameworks Enable Speed

"Good frameworks help you make better decisions faster."

Don't reinvent the wheel. Use proven frameworks, adapt to your context, execute.

### 4. Learn from the Best

"Study successful products. Extract patterns. Apply to your work."

Product sense isn't innate. It's pattern recognition developed through study and practice.

### 5. Make it Actionable

"Understanding is useless without application."

Every framework should answer: "What do I do with this tomorrow?"

## Key Frameworks

### Stakeholder Communication Matrix

**Framework:** Map stakeholders by:
- Power (high/low influence)
- Interest (high/low engagement)

**Action:**
- High power, high interest → Manage closely
- High power, low interest → Keep satisfied
- Low power, high interest → Keep informed
- Low power, low interest → Monitor

**Application:** Determines communication frequency and format for each stakeholder.

### Product Strategy Canvas

**Framework:** One-page strategy that covers:
- Problem you're solving
- Target users
- Value proposition
- Competitive positioning
- Success metrics
- Key initiatives

**Why it works:** Forces clarity and creates alignment on one page.

### Prioritization Framework

**Common approaches Aakash shares:**
- RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)
- Value vs. Effort matrix
- MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
- Kano model

**Key insight:** No single framework is always right. Choose based on your context, stage, and needs.

### The PM Meeting Framework

**Structure for effective meetings:**
1. **Context** (why we're here)
2. **Objective** (what we need to decide/align on)
3. **Discussion** (explore options)
4. **Decision** (what we're committing to)
5. **Next steps** (who does what by when)

**Why it works:** Meetings have clear outcomes, not just discussion.

## How AI Changes Aakash's Contributions

### AI Prototyping as Core PM Skill

**Insight:** Prototyping moved from "nice to have" to "essential PM skill."

**Old PM workflow:**
- Write specs → Wait for eng → Review implementation

**New PM workflow:**
- Prototype concept → Align team → Eng builds production version

**Impact:** PMs who can prototype gain:
- Faster stakeholder alignment
- Better eng communication
- Clearer requirements
- Validated ideas before building

### Tool Comparison Framework

Aakash's AI prototyping guide helps PMs navigate:
- Which tool for which situation
- Pros/cons of each platform
- When to use standalone vs. codebase-aware tools
- Cost considerations

**Value:** Saves PMs from analysis paralysis. Pick one, start building.

### Visual Frameworks in AI Era

**New frameworks needed:**
- AI product strategy canvas (includes evals, costs)
- AI feature prioritization (value + quality + cost)
- Stakeholder communication for AI uncertainty

## When to Use Aakash's Resources

### Use visual frameworks when:
- Communicating complex concepts
- Creating alignment across teams
- Need quick understanding at-a-glance
- Building shared vocabulary

## Common Themes in Aakash's Work

### 1. Clarity Over Complexity

Strip away jargon. Make it simple. If you can't explain it clearly, you don't understand it.

### 2. Templates Accelerate Work

Don't start from scratch. Use templates, adapt to your context, ship faster.

### 3. Communication is a PM Superpower

Technical skills get you in the door. Communication skills determine how far you go.

### 4. Learn in Public

Share what you're learning. Teaching others reinforces your understanding.

### 5. Prototypes > Specs (AI Era)

Show, don't tell. A working prototype communicates better than a written spec.
