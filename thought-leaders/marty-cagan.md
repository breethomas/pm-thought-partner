**Focus:** Product Discovery, Empowered Teams, Product Leadership

**Why He Matters:** Marty codified modern product management practices from his experience at eBay, Netscape, and advising hundreds of tech companies through Silicon Valley Product Group (SVPG).

## Core Philosophy

**"The role of product discovery is to address these critical risks: value risk, usability risk, feasibility risk, and business viability risk."**

Great product teams discover products that are valuable, usable, feasible, and viable - before wasting time and money building the wrong thing.

## Key Frameworks

### The Four Big Risks
Every product idea faces four risks:
1. **Value** - Will customers buy/use it?
2. **Usability** - Can users figure it out?
3. **Feasibility** - Can we build it?
4. **Viability** - Does it work for the business?

Address these through discovery before building.

**See:** `frameworks/discovery/four-risks.md`

### Product Discovery
Test ideas quickly and cheaply with customers.
Use prototypes, not production code.
Validate all four risks before committing to build.

### Empowered Product Teams
Give teams problems to solve, not features to build.
Teams need:
- Skilled PM, designer, engineers
- Clear objectives
- Authority to discover solutions
- Accountability for outcomes

## What Makes Him Different

**Traditional (feature teams):** Stakeholders define features → Teams build them

**Marty's vision (empowered teams):** Leadership sets objectives → Teams discover solutions

**Key insight:** The best solutions come from empowered teams close to customers and technology, not from top-down feature mandates.

## Best For

- Understanding product discovery fundamentals
- Assessing risks before building
- Building empowered product culture
- Transitioning from feature factory to product-led
- Product leadership and organizational design

## AI-Era Adaptation

His frameworks apply directly:
- Four Risks critical for AI (especially feasibility and viability)
- Discovery with prototypes even faster now (prototype in hours!)
- Empowered teams can leverage AI tools for speed
- Value risk remains #1 (AI doesn't change whether customers want it)

## Quotes

> "The role of product is not to build what customers ask for. It's to build what customers need."

> "The biggest flaw in how companies build products is they build first and validate later."

> "Good teams are constantly discovering in parallel with delivering."

> "Fall in love with the problem, not your solution."

## When to Apply His Thinking

- ✅ Evaluating new product ideas
- ✅ Assessing risk before building
- ✅ Transitioning from feature factory
- ✅ Building product culture
- ✅ Structuring product teams

## Practical Tips from Marty

1. **Test value risk first**: Most products fail because no one wants them
2. **Use prototypes**: High-fidelity prototypes, not production code
3. **Involve engineers in discovery**: They see feasibility early
4. **Focus on outcomes**: Give teams problems, not features
5. **Discover continuously**: Don't separate discovery from delivery

- **Jeff Patton** (Story Mapping) - Discovery workshop techniques
- **Melissa Perri** (Product Operations) - Scaling product practices

## Common Misunderstandings

❌ "Discovery means not shipping" - Wrong. Good teams discover AND deliver continuously.

❌ "Only big companies need this" - Wrong. Small teams benefit even more from avoiding waste.

❌ "Engineers shouldn't be involved in discovery" - Wrong. They're critical for feasibility assessment.

❌ "Stakeholder requests should always be followed" - Wrong. They're input, not mandates.

## Marty's Evolution

**Early work (2000s):** Codifying product management practices from HP, Netscape, eBay

**SVPG era (2010s):** Consulting, teaching, writing about product discovery and empowered teams

**Recent focus (2020s):** Product operating models, organizational transformation, product leadership

**On AI:** Acknowledges AI changes tools but not fundamentals - still need to address four risks, still need discovery

---

**Bottom line:** Marty teaches you how to discover valuable, usable, feasible, viable products before wasting time building the wrong thing.

Test all four risks. Empower teams. Discover continuously.
