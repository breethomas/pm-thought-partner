**Focus:** Product strategy, AI integration, marketplace products, scaling consumer products

**Known For:** Product Strategy Stack framework, CPO at Tinder, Product at Facebook/TripAdvisor, CEO of Outpace

## Core Philosophy

Ravi Mehta believes great product strategy comes from a clear, actionable framework—not vague vision statements. Through his work scaling products at Tinder, Facebook, and TripAdvisor, he developed a systematic approach to product strategy that balances vision with execution.

For AI products specifically, Ravi argues that winning doesn't require building frontier models. Success comes from combining off-the-shelf AI capabilities with what's uniquely yours: proprietary data, product functionality, and customer insights.

## Key Frameworks

### Product Strategy Stack

**The framework:** Ravi created a layered approach to product strategy that ensures alignment from vision to execution.

**The stack (top to bottom):**

1. **Company Mission** - Why the company exists
2. **Product Vision** - What you're building toward
3. **Strategic Pillars** - Key focus areas
4. **Product Roadmap** - Initiatives to execute pillars
5. **Goals & Metrics** - How you measure success

**Why it matters:** Each layer informs the next. Strategy isn't a one-time document—it's a living framework that connects vision to daily decisions.

**Key insight:** Most teams jump straight to roadmap without clarifying pillars. This creates misalignment and wasted effort.

**Application:**
- Use when setting product direction
- Revisit quarterly as you learn
- Ensure each roadmap item connects to a strategic pillar
- Metrics should ladder up to pillars and vision

### AI Product Integration Framework

**The problem:** Many companies think they need to build frontier AI models to compete. This leads to either:
- **Overinvestment:** Building models from scratch (expensive, slow)
- **Underinvestment:** Ignoring AI entirely (falling behind)

**Ravi's solution:** "AI magnifies the value of what your company already has."

**The framework: Three elements create defensible AI products**

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  AI Capabilities        │ ← Democratized (everyone has access)
│  (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)  │
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
            ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Your Proprietary Data  │ ← Unique to you
│  (customer data,        │
│   usage patterns,       │
│   domain knowledge)     │
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
            ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Your Functionality     │ ← Unique to you
│  (workflows, UX,        │
│   integrations, tools)  │
└─────────────────────────┘
            ║
            ▼
    Defensible AI Product
```

**The four interaction patterns:**

**1. Context:** Your data informs AI decisions
- Example: Customer support AI uses your ticket history to provide better answers
- Why it matters: Generic AI doesn't know your customers, products, or domain

**2. Output:** AI-generated insights become proprietary assets
- Example: AI analyzes your user data to create custom insights
- Why it matters: Competitors can't replicate insights from data they don't have

**3. Orchestration:** You decide when/how to invoke AI
- Example: Your product determines which queries need AI vs. rules-based logic
- Why it matters: Intelligence in orchestration creates better UX and economics

**4. Tool Use:** AI leverages your product as an instrument
- Example: AI uses your internal tools to complete tasks
- Why it matters: AI augments existing capabilities you've already built

### Marketplace Product Principles

From his work at TripAdvisor and Tinder (both two-sided marketplaces):

**Key insights:**
- Supply and demand must grow in balance
- Focus on one side first (usually supply)
- Quality matters more than quantity
- Network effects take time to compound

**Application to AI products:**
- Some AI products are marketplaces (AI-generated content + consumers)
- Need to balance AI output quality with user demand
- Can't just generate infinite AI content—need quality control

## Core Principles

### 1. Strategy Should Be Actionable

"Strategy isn't a vision statement. It's a framework that guides daily decisions."

Good strategy answers:
- What are we building?
- Why does it matter?
- How do we know we're succeeding?
- What aren't we doing?

### 2. You Don't Need Frontier Models to Win at AI

"Competitors can access the same models. They can't access your data, your functionality, or your understanding of customers."

Your moat isn't the AI model. It's:
- Proprietary data that provides context
- Product functionality that AI enhances
- Deep customer insights that inform AI behavior

### 3. Build Your Strategy Stack Top-Down, Execute Bottom-Up

**Planning:** Start with mission, cascade to metrics
**Execution:** Start with experiments, roll up to pillars

This creates alignment without rigidity.

### 4. Product Strategy Evolves

"Your strategy should change as you learn. Rigidity kills product teams."

Revisit quarterly:
- What did we learn?
- What changed in the market?
- Do our pillars still make sense?
- Should we adjust?

## How AI Changes Ravi's Frameworks

### Product Strategy Stack + AI

**New considerations for each layer:**

**Company Mission:** Does AI enable our mission better?
**Product Vision:** What does AI-powered version look like?
**Strategic Pillars:** Should "AI integration" be a pillar?
**Product Roadmap:** Which features get AI first?
**Goals & Metrics:** New metrics for AI quality and cost

### AI Integration Changes Competitive Dynamics

**Old moats:**
- Network effects
- Data advantages
- Switching costs

**AI-era moats:**
- Data + AI context (not just data)
- Functionality that AI augments (not just features)
- Orchestration intelligence (when/how to use AI)
- Customer understanding (what problems AI should solve)

**Key shift:** Data alone isn't enough. It's data + how you apply AI to it.

## When to Use Ravi's Frameworks

### Use Product Strategy Stack when:
- Setting annual or quarterly product direction
- Aligning teams on priorities
- Explaining product decisions to stakeholders
- Onboarding new PMs to strategy
- Auditing if roadmap connects to mission

### Use AI Integration Framework when:
- Deciding how to add AI to existing product
- Evaluating build vs. buy for AI capabilities
- Identifying your defensible advantages in AI
- Designing AI features that leverage your strengths
- Avoiding the "rebuild everything with AI" trap

### Use Marketplace Insights when:
- Building two-sided products
- Balancing supply and demand
- Scaling network effects
- Managing quality at scale

## Ravi's Unique Contribution

**What makes his perspective different:**

### 1. Strategy Execution Bridge
Most thought leaders focus on either strategy (Marty) or execution (Teresa). Ravi bridges both with actionable frameworks.

### 2. AI Integration (Not AI-Native)
Most AI content is about building AI products from scratch. Ravi helps you integrate AI into existing products.

### 3. Proven at Scale
He's scaled products to hundreds of millions across different domains (dating, social, travel). His frameworks are battle-tested.

### 4. Marketplace Experience
Deep understanding of two-sided products—relevant as some AI products become marketplaces (AI content + users).

## Common Questions

### "Should we build our own AI model?"

**Ravi's answer:** Probably not.

Ask instead:
- Do you have proprietary data that provides unique context?
- Do you have product functionality AI can enhance?
- Do you understand your customers' AI needs better than anyone?

If yes to these → Use off-the-shelf models + your advantages.

Only build custom models if:
- You have massive scale (millions of users)
- Specific domain needs GPT-4 can't handle
- Cost savings justify investment (rare)

### "How do we compete when everyone has access to the same AI?"

**Ravi's answer:** Your moat isn't the model.

Differentiation comes from:
- **Data:** Your customer data, usage patterns, domain knowledge
- **Functionality:** Your product features that AI augments
- **Orchestration:** How you decide to use AI
- **Understanding:** Deep knowledge of customer problems

Competitors can copy your model choice. They can't copy these.

### "How does our product strategy change with AI?"

**Ravi's answer:** Your mission probably doesn't change. How you achieve it might.

Revisit your Product Strategy Stack:
- Does AI enable your mission better?
- What does AI-powered vision look like?
- Should you add "AI integration" as strategic pillar?
- Which roadmap items benefit from AI?
- What new metrics matter (AI quality, cost)?
