**Focus:** Product-market fit measurement, user segmentation, building delightful products

**Known For:** PMF survey framework ("very disappointed" metric), CEO of Superhuman

## Core Philosophy

Rahul Vohra believes product-market fit should be measurable, not just a feeling. At Superhuman, he developed a quantitative framework for measuring and systematically improving PMF before scaling.

His approach combines rigorous measurement with deep user empathy. The goal isn't just to achieve PMF, but to build products that users love so much they'd be "very disappointed" without them.

## Key Framework: The PMF Survey

### The Origin Story

When Superhuman was still in beta with thousands on the waitlist, Rahul needed to know: "Do we have PMF?"

Traditional metrics (growth, revenue) weren't enough. He needed a leading indicator that would predict success.

He adapted Sean Ellis's question: **"How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?"**
- Very disappointed
- Somewhat disappointed
- Not disappointed
- N/A - I no longer use it

### The 40% Benchmark

**Sean Ellis discovered:** Products with >40% of users saying "very disappointed" consistently showed strong PMF and sustainable growth.

**Below 40%:** Struggle to grow efficiently
**Above 40%:** Ready to scale

This became Rahul's North Star: Get to 40% before scaling.

### The Full Framework (Beyond the Question)

Rahul's innovation wasn't just the survey - it was what to do with the data.

**The Four-Step Process:**

**1. Survey your users**
- Ask the core PMF question
- Ask: "What is the main benefit you receive from this product?"
- Ask: "What type of person would most benefit from this product?"
- Ask: "How can we improve this product for you?"

**2. Segment your respondents**
- **Very disappointed:** Your core users
- **Somewhat disappointed:** On the fence
- **Not disappointed:** Wrong audience

**3. Analyze by segment**

**For "very disappointed" users:**
- What benefits do they mention? → Your core value prop
- Who do they say would benefit? → Your target market
- This is WHO to build for and WHAT matters to them

**For "somewhat disappointed" users:**
- What improvements do they want?
- Do these align with "very disappointed" user needs?
  - **If yes:** Build these features (convert "somewhat" to "very")
  - **If no:** Ignore them (they're not your market)

**For "not disappointed" users:**
- Ignore them completely
- They're the wrong audience
- Don't build for them

**4. Build your PMF engine**

The Strategy:
```
Support "very disappointed" users
    ↓
Convert "somewhat disappointed" (if aligned)
    ↓
Acquire more "very disappointed" lookalikes
    ↓
Measure PMF score quarterly
    ↓
Target: >40%
```

### Superhuman's Journey

**Initial PMF score:** 22% (below threshold)

**Analysis:**
- "Very disappointed" users: Email power users processing 100+ emails/day
- Main benefit: "Get through email blazingly fast"
- Needed: Better keyboard shortcuts, faster search, speed optimizations

**Actions:**
- Built features for power users
- Improved speed everywhere
- Targeted lookalike users in acquisition
- Delayed broad launch until PMF improved

**Result:** 58% PMF score → Scaled confidently

## Core Principles

### 1. PMF is Measurable

"You can quantify product-market fit. You should measure it before you scale."

Don't rely on gut feel. The PMF survey gives you a number you can track over time.

### 2. Segment, Then Build

"Not all users are created equal. Build for the ones who love you."

Focus on "very disappointed" users. They define your value prop and target market.

### 3. Ignore the Wrong Users

"Trying to please everyone dilutes your product."

"Not disappointed" users will pull you in wrong directions. Have the discipline to ignore them.

### 4. PMF Before Scale

"Scaling before PMF is like stepping on the gas with a flat tire."

Fix the fundamentals before growth. Get to 40% before heavy acquisition investment.

### 5. Delight Over Feature Parity

"Don't build what competitors have. Build what makes users say 'wow.'"

Superhuman didn't just match Gmail. They made email delightful for power users.

## The PMF Engine in Practice

### When to Run the Survey

**Timing:**
- After users have experienced your core value (not day 1)
- Minimum 2-4 weeks of usage
- When you have 30+ active users
- Repeat quarterly to track progress

**Who to survey:**
- Active users (used in last 30 days)
- Users who've completed onboarding
- Users who've hit your "aha moment"

**Don't survey:**
- Brand new users (no opinion yet)
- Churned users (biased sample)
- Trial users who haven't activated

### Interpreting Results

**PMF Score = % "very disappointed"** (excluding N/A responses)

**>40%:** You have PMF
- Time to scale acquisition
- Optimize conversion and retention
- Expand to adjacent markets

**25-40%:** You're improving
- Keep building for "very disappointed" users
- Convert aligned "somewhat" users
- Don't scale yet

**<25%:** Weak PMF
- Major product work needed
- Reconsider target market or value prop
- Don't invest in acquisition

### The Product Roadmap

**From the survey, build:**

**Tier 1:** What "very disappointed" users need
- These are your must-haves
- Directly improve PMF score

**Tier 2:** What "somewhat" users want (if aligned)
- Only if needs match Tier 1 users
- Converts fence-sitters

**Tier 3:** Everything else
- Ignore for now
- Doesn't improve PMF

## How AI Changes PMF Measurement

### AI Products Have Different Patterns

**Traditional SaaS:**
- Clear activation moment
- Predictable usage patterns
- Retention curves stabilize

**AI Products:**
- Output quality varies
- Usage patterns less predictable
- Retention depends on AI performance

### Modified PMF Questions for AI

**Still ask:** "How disappointed would you be?"

**But add:**
- "How often does the AI give you useful results?"
- "When the AI fails, how do you feel?"
- "Do you trust the AI's outputs?"
- "Is the AI worth the price?"

**Why:** AI products need quality metrics, not just usage metrics.

### Cost Consideration

**Traditional PMF:** More engaged users = better
**AI PMF:** More engaged users = higher costs

Must balance:
- User love (PMF score)
- Unit economics (cost per engaged user)

High PMF with negative unit economics = unsustainable.

## When to Use Rahul's Framework

### Use the PMF survey when:
- You're pre-scale and need to know if you have PMF
- You want a quantitative measure of PMF progress
- You need to identify your core users and value prop
- You're deciding what features to build next
- You're unsure if you should invest in growth

### Don't use the survey when:
- You have <30 active users (insufficient data)
- Users haven't experienced core value yet
- You're in rapid iteration mode (wait until stable)
- You already know you have strong PMF and just need to scale

### Combine with:
- **Teresa Torres' discovery** - Qualitative depth + quantitative validation
- **Lenny's PMF indicators** - Multiple lenses on PMF
- **Brian's Four Fits** - Validate market-product fit specifically
- **Retention curves** - Leading indicator of PMF strength

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Surveying too early** - Users need time to experience value

❌ **Trying to please everyone** - Build for "very disappointed," not everyone

❌ **Building for "somewhat" users whose needs don't align** - This dilutes your product

❌ **Only running once** - PMF evolves, measure quarterly

❌ **Not acting on results** - The survey is useless without follow-through

❌ **Scaling before 40%** - You'll waste money acquiring users for a product that doesn't have PMF

## Quotes to Remember

> "Product-market fit is when your customers would be very disappointed if your product went away."

> "Not all users are created equal. Build for the ones who love you, not the ones who tolerate you."

> "If you can quantify PMF, you can systematically improve it."

> "We had to say no to a lot of good ideas to stay focused on what would delight our core users."

> "Scaling before PMF is like stepping on the gas with a flat tire."
