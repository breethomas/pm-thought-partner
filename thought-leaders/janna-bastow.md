**Known For:** Inventing the Now-Next-Later roadmap framework, co-founder of ProdPad and Mind the Product

## Core Philosophy

Janna Bastow believes traditional timeline-based roadmaps are lies we tell ourselves and our stakeholders. They create false certainty in an inherently uncertain environment.

Her innovation - the Now-Next-Later roadmap - embraces uncertainty while still providing direction. It acknowledges that the further out you plan, the less you actually know.

## Key Framework: Now-Next-Later Roadmapping

### The Problem with Traditional Roadmaps

**Gantt chart roadmaps:**
```
Q1: Feature A, Feature B
Q2: Feature C, Feature D
Q3: Feature E, Feature F
```

**What's wrong:**
- ❌ Commits to dates too early
- ❌ Ignores uncertainty (things change!)
- ❌ Becomes a contract, not a plan
- ❌ Doesn't account for learning
- ❌ Teams feel locked in even when priorities shift
- ❌ Creates false expectations with stakeholders

### The Now-Next-Later Solution

**Three time horizons based on certainty:**

```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  NOW (High Certainty)          │
│  - Currently in development    │
│  - Well-defined               │
│  - Next few weeks/sprints     │
└────────────────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  NEXT (Medium Certainty)       │
│  - Being validated            │
│  - Up next after NOW items    │
│  - Next 1-3 months           │
└────────────────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  LATER (Low Certainty)         │
│  - Exploring                  │
│  - May or may not happen      │
│  - 3+ months, fuzzy future    │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Cone of Uncertainty

**The insight:** The further out you plan, the less certain things become.

```
    High Certainty
        |
     NOW│
        |    Medium Certainty
        │
      NEXT│
        |       Low Certainty
        │
      LATER│
```

**Key principle:** Stop pretending you can predict the future. Embrace uncertainty.

### The Origin Story

Janna and co-founder Simon Cast created this framework in 2012 while building ProdPad. They initially called it "Current/Near Term/Future," but an early customer dubbed it "Now-Next-Later" and the name stuck.

They were frustrated with traditional roadmapping that forced false certainty and created broken promises to stakeholders.

## Core Principles

### 1. Embrace Uncertainty

"The cone of uncertainty is real. The further out you look, the less you know. Your roadmap should reflect that."

Don't fake certainty. Communicate realistic confidence levels.

### 2. Sequence Over Dates

"Focus on sequence and certainty level, not specific dates."

Stakeholders benefit more from knowing "this is NOW vs. NEXT" than "this ships March 15th" (which will change anyway).

### 3. Outcomes Over Features

"Roadmaps should communicate the problem you're solving, not just the feature you're shipping."

**Bad:** "Add dark mode"
**Good:** "Help users work comfortably at night → exploring dark mode"

### 4. Roadmaps Are Living Documents

"Your roadmap should evolve as you learn. Things move between columns. Priorities change."

Healthy flow:
```
LATER → NEXT → NOW → SHIPPED
```

Items also move backward when priorities shift.

### 5. Flexibility is Strength

"The best roadmaps enable teams to pivot based on learning, not lock them into commitments."

Being able to respond to change is more valuable than following a plan.

## How to Use Now-Next-Later

### NOW Column

**What goes here:**
- Items in active development
- Well-defined scope
- High certainty it will ship
- Typically 1-3 items max

**Communicate:**
- "We're working on this now"
- "Expected to ship in next few weeks"

**Avoid:**
- Too many items (dilutes focus)
- Vague items (should be well-defined by this point)

### NEXT Column

**What goes here:**
- Items being validated and refined
- Up next after NOW items complete
- Discovery work happening
- 3-5 items typically

**Communicate:**
- "We're planning to work on this next"
- "Subject to change based on learning"
- "Actively doing discovery"

**Avoid:**
- Treating as commitments (they're plans, not promises)
- Too much detail (scope can still change)

### LATER Column

**What goes here:**
- Ideas being explored
- Future considerations
- Items that might never happen
- Can have many items

**Communicate:**
- "We're considering this"
- "No commitment yet"
- "Depends on how NOW and NEXT go"

**Avoid:**
- Over-specifying (it's fuzzy for a reason)
- Making promises about LATER items

## Stakeholder Communication

### Instead of: "Feature X ships Q3 2025"

**Say:**
"Feature X is in NEXT - we're validating it now and expect to start development after our current NOW items complete. Timing depends on what we learn."

**Why this works:**
- Sets realistic expectations
- Acknowledges uncertainty
- Maintains flexibility
- Doesn't create false commitments

### The Stakeholder Update

```
NOW:
- Improving onboarding (ships next week)
  → Increase activation rate

NEXT:
- Exploring mobile app (discovery underway)
  → Enable on-the-go usage

LATER:
- Considering integration marketplace
  → Expand use cases
```

**What this communicates:**
- Clear on current work (NOW)
- Transparent about what's next (NEXT)
- Honest about future thinking (LATER)
- Outcome-focused (why we're building it)

## How AI Changes Roadmapping

### Prototyping Accelerates Movement

**Traditional:**
- LATER item takes weeks to scope
- Slowly moves to NEXT over months
- Eventually reaches NOW

**AI era:**
- LATER item can be prototyped in hours
- Rapid validation moves it to NEXT faster
- Or kills it faster based on learning

**Impact:** Items move between columns more frequently. Roadmap is more dynamic.

### Increased Flexibility

**AI enables:**
- Prototype competing LATER ideas quickly
- Validate NEXT items with working examples
- Pivot faster based on user feedback

**Roadmap becomes:**
- More responsive to learning
- Updated more frequently
- Based on evidence, not speculation

### Stakeholder Expectations

**AI era challenge:** "Why can't you just build all five prototypes?"

**Janna's answer would be:**
"Prototyping fast doesn't mean we should build everything. NOW is still about focus. We validate in LATER, commit in NOW."

## When to Use Now-Next-Later

### Use this framework when:
- Communicating roadmap to stakeholders
- Planning with high uncertainty
- Managing stakeholder expectations
- Prioritizing with flexibility
- Avoiding false date commitments

### Works especially well for:
- Early-stage products (high uncertainty)
- Rapidly changing markets
- Discovery-driven development
- Agile/lean teams

### Less suitable for:
- Fixed-deadline contracts (legal commitments)
- Highly regulated environments with compliance dates
- Hardware products with manufacturing lead times

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**Combines perfectly with:**

**Teresa Torres' Continuous Discovery:**
- Discovery feeds your roadmap
- LATER items come from opportunity solution trees
- NEXT items move there after validation
- NOW items are validated opportunities

**Marty Cagan's Four Risks:**
- Use discovery to validate risks
- Items move from LATER → NEXT → NOW as risks reduce

**Prototype-First Development:**
- Prototype LATER items to test viability
- Validation moves items to NEXT
- Working prototypes inform NOW development

**Brian Balfour's Focus:**
- NOW column should be focused (1-3 items)
- Don't dilute with too many parallel initiatives
- Serial focus on NOW items

## Common Objections Answered

### "But stakeholders want dates!"

**Answer:** Give them sequence and certainty instead.

"We're working on X now (high certainty, ships soon). Y is next (medium certainty, after X). Z is later (low certainty, depends on learning)."

This is often MORE useful than "Q3 2025" which becomes outdated.

### "How do I know what to put where?"

**Criteria:**

**NOW:**
- In active development?
- Scope locked?
- Team building it?

**NEXT:**
- Validated enough to commit soon?
- Discovery underway?
- Likely to start in 4-8 weeks?

**LATER:**
- Still exploring?
- Might get deprioritized?
- No timeline yet?

### "Can I add timeframes?"

**Optional approach:**
- NOW: "Shipping in next 2-4 weeks"
- NEXT: "Starting in next 1-3 months"
- LATER: "3+ months, TBD"

But avoid specific dates (no "March 15th").

### "What if priorities change?"

**Answer:** That's the point! Items move.

- NEXT items can move back to LATER
- LATER items can jump to NOW if priorities shift
- Movement is healthy, not failure

## Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too many items in NOW** - Should be 1-3 max, not 10
❌ **Treating NEXT like commitments** - It's a plan, not a promise
❌ **Not moving items backward** - Healthy to deprioritize
❌ **Getting too detailed in LATER** - Keep it high-level
❌ **Using it like a timeline** - It's sequence + certainty, not dates

## Quotes to Remember

> "The quality of a product roadmap is inversely proportional to the number of dates on it."

> "The cone of uncertainty is real. Your roadmap should reflect reality, not fantasy."

> "A roadmap is not a commitment. It's a strategic communication tool."

> "The best roadmaps help teams make better decisions, not lock them into worse ones."

> "Stop promising dates you can't keep. Start being honest about uncertainty."

**In the context of this PM Thought Partner:**

Janna's framework helps you communicate plans without false commitments.

Use it to:
- Manage stakeholder expectations (sequence + certainty, not dates)
- Plan with flexibility (acknowledge and embrace uncertainty)
- Show strategic thinking (outcomes, not just features)
- Enable pivots (items move as you learn)
- Align with discovery (continuous learning informs movement)

Combined with Teresa's discovery, Brian's focus, and AI-era prototyping, you have: rapid learning → focused execution → flexible planning → honest communication.
