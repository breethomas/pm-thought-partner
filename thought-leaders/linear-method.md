# Linear Method

**Focus:** Modern Product Development, Issues Not Stories, Building with Momentum

**Why It Matters:** Linear reimagined product development tools and workflows for the AI era. Their method eliminates ceremony and focuses on clarity, speed, and quality craftsmanship.

## Core Philosophy

**"Direction, Building, Quality."**

Set clear direction. Build with momentum. Maintain quality through how it feels to craft.

Skip the ceremony. Communicate clearly. Ship continuously.

## Key Principles

### Issues, Not User Stories
Write clear, direct descriptions of what needs to be built.
Skip the "As a user, I want..." theater.

**Bad:** "As a user, I want to export data so that I can analyze it"
**Good:** "Add CSV export button to analytics dashboard"

**See:** `frameworks/ai-era-practices/issues-not-stories.md`

### Direction → Building → Quality

**Direction:**
- Define outcomes, not features
- Set clear priorities
- Give teams context

**Building:**
- Build with momentum
- Ship continuously
- Maintain flow

**Quality:**
- Feel it in the crafting
- Build things you're proud of
- Quality is felt, not specified

### Transparency and Collaboration
- Build alongside users, not in isolation
- Operate transparently
- Make everyone feel like they're part of something

### Remove Ceremony
- No pointless meetings
- No status updates for status updates
- No heavy processes that slow you down
- Write only what's needed

## What Makes Them Different

**Traditional:** Jira, user stories, sprint ceremonies, heavy process

**Linear:** Issues, clarity, continuous shipping, minimal ceremony

**Key insight:** Most product development process is theater. Cut it and move faster.

## Best For

- Modern product development workflows
- Reducing process overhead
- Writing better issues
- Building with speed and quality
- Creating momentum-based culture

## AI-Era Fit

Linear's philosophy is BUILT for the AI era:
- Issues, not stories = clearer for AI tools
- Less ceremony = faster shipping
- Continuous deployment = rapid iteration
- Quality through craft = what matters when everyone has AI

**Their take:** "The best product work happens when you remove obstacles and let teams build."

## Quotes

> "User stories have become a cargo cult ritual that feels good but wastes a lot of resources and time."

> "The best way to communicate what you're building is to build it and show people."

> "Quality isn't something you test for at the end. It's something you feel while building."

> "Direction is about clarity, not control."

## When to Apply This Thinking

- ✅ Setting up product development workflows
- ✅ Reducing ceremony in your process
- ✅ Writing better issues/tasks
- ✅ Building culture of craftsmanship
- ✅ Shipping continuously

## Practical Tips from Linear

1. **Write issues, not stories**: Be direct about what needs to be built
2. **Set direction, not tasks**: Give context, let teams figure out how
3. **Ship continuously**: Small, frequent releases > big launches
4. **Remove status theater**: No standups just to have standups
5. **Feel quality**: If it doesn't feel good to build, it won't be good

## Related Thinkers

Works well with:
- **Prototype-First** - Fast building, low ceremony
- **Basecamp's Shape Up** - Similar anti-ceremony philosophy
- **Agile Manifesto** - Principles over processes (though they'd skip most agile ceremony)

## Common Misunderstandings

❌ "No user stories means no user focus" - Wrong. You still focus on users, just skip the format.

❌ "This only works for small teams" - Wrong. Linear scales to hundreds of engineers.

❌ "No ceremonies means chaos" - Wrong. Clear direction + good issues = clarity without overhead.

❌ "Quality suffers with speed" - Wrong. Quality through craftsmanship, not through slow process.

## Linear's Evolution

**Origins (2019):** Founded by Karri Saarinen (ex-Airbnb), Tuomas Artman (ex-Uber), and team

**Philosophy development:** Codified their approach to building products through their own experience

**Current (2024+):** Widely adopted by modern startups and tech companies as alternative to Jira

**On AI:** Their method is perfectly suited for AI era - less ceremony, faster shipping, clearer communication for AI tools

## Why This Matters for AI-Era PMs

Linear's philosophy aligns with AI-era realities:
- **AI tools need clarity**: "Add export button" > user story format
- **Speed is the moat**: Less ceremony = faster shipping
- **Continuous deployment**: Ship small, learn fast
- **Quality through craft**: What differentiates when everyone has AI
- **No coordination overhead**: AI handles the busywork

## Key Concepts

### Cycles (not sprints)
Predictable cadence (often 2 weeks) but not rigid.
Scope can flex. Finish quality work.

### Projects (not epics)
Group related work. But don't over-plan.
Build, learn, adapt.

### Roadmap = Now-Next-Later
Not Gantt charts. Not dates.
Honest about certainty.

### Make It Personal
People should feel proud of what they're building.
Quality comes from caring.

**Bottom line:** Linear teaches you to remove ceremony, write clearly, build with momentum, and ship continuously.

Write issues, not stories. Set direction. Build with quality. Move fast.
