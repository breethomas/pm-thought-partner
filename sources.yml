  core_principle: >
    This PM Thought Partner synthesizes publicly available wisdom from top
    practitioners. It does not claim to create new frameworks—only to curate,
    adapt, and integrate proven frameworks for AI-era product management.

  every_framework_must_have:
    - "Attribution to original creator"
    - "Link to publicly available source content"
    - "Clear explanation of the framework"
    - "Practical application guidance"
    - "AI-era adaptations where relevant"

  what_this_project_adds:
    - "Curation of best PM frameworks in one place"
    - "AI-era adaptations and integrations"
    - "Cross-framework connections and applications"
    - "Modern execution practices (prototype-first, issues not stories)"
    - "Templates and practical deliverables"
    - "Systematic approach to applying proven wisdom"

  open_source_approach:
    - "All sources publicly attributed"
    - "Community contributions welcome"
    - "Quality standards maintained"
    - "Regular updates as frameworks evolve"

  maintenance:
    - "Check source links quarterly"
