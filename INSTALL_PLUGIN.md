## Installation

> **Note:** PM Thought Partner is not yet in the Claude Code Marketplace. For now, installation requires cloning from GitHub. Once published to the marketplace, installation will be simpler: `claude plugin install pm-thought-partner`

### Option 1: Ask Claude (Easiest)

**Just ask Claude Code CLI to install it:**

```
Install the PM Thought Partner plugin from
https://github.com/breethomas/pm-thought-partner
```

Claude will handle everything - cloning the repo, setting up the plugin directory, and verifying the installation.

---

### Option 2: Clone and Run Install Script

**Automated setup with install script:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/breethomas/pm-thought-partner.git ~/.claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner
cd ~/.claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner
./install.sh
```

The install script will automatically symlink the slash commands to `~/.claude/commands/`.

### Option 3: Manual Installation (No Script)

**If you prefer full control:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/breethomas/pm-thought-partner.git ~/.claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner
ln -sf ~/.claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

---

## Set Up Competitive Research Directory (Optional)

**First time running `/competitive-research`?** The command will guide you through creating a personal research directory.

**Why a separate directory?**
- Keeps competitive intel separate from company codebases
- You own your strategic research, independent of employer
- No risk of accidentally committing sensitive analysis to git

**Recommended setup:**
```
~/Documents/pm-work/competitive-research/
```

The command will ask you where to save competitive research on first run and remember your preference.

---

## Connect Your Issue Tracker (Highly Recommended)

**One-liner value:** Auto-analyze 50+ issues in 10 seconds with `/lno-prioritize` instead of spending hours in spreadsheets.

**The real power of this plugin** is applying frameworks from Marty Cagan, Elena Verna, and Brian Balfour directly to your backlogâ€”not just talking about them.

### What MCP Integration Unlocks

**Backlog automation** (this is where MCP shines):
- **`/lno-prioritize`** - Analyze your entire backlog and auto-label by impact (Leverage/Neutral/Overhead)
- **`/four-risks [issue-id]`** - Pull issue details, assess all four risks, add analysis as comment
- **`/now-next-later`** - Generate roadmap from your Linear projects or GitHub milestones

**Strategic frameworks** (these work great without MCP too):
- **`/growth-loops`**, **`/four-fits`**, **`/ai-cost-check`** - Best with your voice-to-text context
- MCP lets you attach analysis to issues (optional), but doesn't read issues for insights

---

### Option 1: Linear MCP

**Why Linear?**
- Built for product teams (roadmaps, discovery, prioritization)
- Linear Method is one of our core frameworks
- Rich project/issue metadata

**Setup (2 minutes):**

Just ask Claude:
```
Set up the Linear MCP server for me
```

Claude will prompt you for your Linear API key and configure everything.

**Get your Linear API key:** [linear.app/settings/api](https://linear.app/settings/api)

**Or manually:**
```bash
claude mcp add linear
```

Follow the prompts to add your Linear API key.

---

### Option 2: GitHub MCP

**Already have GitHub connected?** The PM Thought Partner will automatically detect and use it.

**What you get:**
- Same slash command capabilities as Linear MCP
- Issue management, PR integration, project boards
- Full create/update/label capabilities
- Great if your team already lives in GitHub

**Setup:**
Use the [GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)

**Not set up yet?**
```
Set up the GitHub MCP server for me
```

---

### Option 3: No Integration

**Works fine without either!** You can:
- Paste issues or project lists manually
- Describe your backlog in conversation
- Still get all framework guidance and strategic advice

The slash commands will prompt you for manual input instead of pulling from an integration.

---

### Test It Works

Start a new Claude Code session in any project and ask:

**"Should I write a PRD or prototype first?"**

**Expected behavior:** Claude pushes you toward prototyping, references frameworks, challenges assumptions.

**Try slash commands:**
- `/strategy-session` - Work through product decisions conversationally
- `/reflect` - Analyze patterns across your strategic thinking
- `/competitive-research` - Parallel competitor analysis with synthesis
- `/lno-prioritize` - Categorize issues by impact
- `/four-risks` - Run risk assessment on a feature
- `/now-next-later` - Generate a roadmap

**[â†’ See all commands and detailed usage in README](README.md)**

---

## Updating

**To get the latest frameworks:**

```
Update the PM Thought Partner plugin to the latest version
```

Claude will pull the latest changes from GitHub.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Slash commands aren't working"**
- Make sure you're in a Claude Code session (`claude` command)
- Check if commands are symlinked: `ls -la ~/.claude/commands/` should show the command files
- If commands aren't symlinked, run: `ln -sf ~/.claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/`
- Try using natural language: "Apply LNO prioritization to my issues"

**"Claude says it can't find Linear issues"**
- Check Linear MCP is set up: Ask Claude "Is Linear MCP configured?"
- Verify Linear API key is correct
- Try: "List my Linear issues" to test connection

**"The frameworks seem generic"**
- Ask specific questions: "Apply the Four Risks framework to this feature"
- Reference frameworks by name
- Give context about your product and situation

---

## What's Next?

Once installed, use your PM Thought Partner for:
- Feature validation before building
- Backlog prioritization
- Growth strategy planning
- Roadmap generation
- PMF measurement
- AI adoption planning

**This is your on-demand PM advisor, grounded in frameworks from the world's best product leaders.**

<summary><strong>Advanced: Manual Installation</strong></summary>

If you prefer to install manually without asking Claude:

### Global Install (Available in all projects)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/breethomas/pm-thought-partner.git

# Symlink to Claude's plugins directory (recommended)
ln -s "$(pwd)/pm-thought-partner" ~/.claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner

# Symlink the slash commands
ln -sf ~/.claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Or copy if you prefer a stable version
mkdir -p ~/.claude/plugins
cp -r pm-thought-partner ~/.claude/plugins/
ln -sf ~/.claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

**Tip:** Plugin symlink is better - `git pull` updates automatically apply. Commands must always be symlinked to `~/.claude/commands/`.

### Per-Project Install (Team access)

```bash
# In YOUR project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Add as project plugin
mkdir -p .claude/plugins
cp -r /path/to/pm-thought-partner .claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner

# Symlink the slash commands to global commands directory
ln -sf "$(pwd)/.claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner/commands"/*.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Commit to your repo
git add .claude/
git commit -m "Add PM Thought Partner plugin"
git push
```

**Note:** Commands are still symlinked to `~/.claude/commands/` globally, but the plugin content lives in your project.

### Verify Manual Installation

```bash
# Check global install
ls -la ~/.claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner

# Check per-project install
ls -la .claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner

# Check commands are linked
ls -la ~/.claude/commands/
```
