---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed ([get it here](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/claude-code))
- Git (for cloning the repo)
- Command line access (Terminal on Mac/Linux, PowerShell on Windows)

### Choose Your Install Type

**Option A: Global Install (Recommended for Individual PMs)**

Use PM Thought Partner across ALL your projects and repos.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/breethomas/pm-thought-partner.git

# Copy to Claude's plugins directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/plugins
cp -r pm-thought-partner ~/.claude/plugins/

# Or create a symlink (easier for updates)
ln -s "$(pwd)/pm-thought-partner" ~/.claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner
```

This makes it available in all your Claude Code sessions.

**Tip:** Use symlink if you want to `git pull` updates easily. Use copy if you want a stable version.

**When to use global:**
- You're a PM working across multiple projects
- You want frameworks available in any Claude Code session
- You're an individual user (not coordinating with a team)

---

**Option B: Per-Project Install (For Teams)**

Install only in specific project repositories where your team wants PM frameworks.

```bash
# In YOUR project directory (not pm-thought-partner)
cd /path/to/your/project

# Add as project plugin
mkdir -p .claude/plugins
cp -r /path/to/pm-thought-partner .claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner

# Commit to your repo
git add .claude/
git commit -m "Add PM Thought Partner plugin"
git push
```

Team members automatically get the plugin when they work on this project.

**When to use per-project:**
- You're on a product team and want shared frameworks
- You only want it in product repos (not infrastructure/backend repos)
- You want version control over which frameworks the team uses

---

### Verify Installation

**For global install:**
```bash
# Check if directory exists
ls -la ~/.claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner
```

You should see the plugin files.

**For per-project install:**
```bash
# In your project directory
ls -la .claude/plugins/pm-thought-partner
```

You should see the plugin files.

---

### Test It Works

```bash
# Start Claude Code in any directory (global) or your project (per-project)
claude code
```

Then ask: "Should I write a PRD or prototype first?"

**Expected behavior:** Claude pushes you toward prototyping, references frameworks, challenges assumptions.

---

## Adding Linear Integration (Optional)

The plugin includes powerful Linear integration for applying frameworks directly to your backlog.

**What Linear integration enables:**
- `/lno-prioritize` - Categorize Linear issues by impact (Leverage/Neutral/Overhead)
- `/four-risks [issue-id]` - Run Marty Cagan's risk assessment on specific issues
- `/now-next-later` - Generate roadmap from Linear projects
- Auto-label issues with framework categorizations

### Setup Linear MCP Server

**Prerequisites:**
- Linear account
- Linear API key ([get one here](https://linear.app/settings/api))

**Install Linear MCP server:**

```bash
# Using Claude Code CLI
claude mcp add linear

# Follow prompts to add your Linear API key
```

**Alternative: Manual setup**

1. Create `.claude/mcp.json` in your home directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "linear": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@linear/mcp-server"],
         "env": {
           "LINEAR_API_KEY": "your-linear-api-key-here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Restart Claude Code

**Verify Linear connection:**
Ask Claude: "List my Linear issues" or run `/lno-prioritize`

---

## Quick Start

Once installed, try:

### Using the Thought Partner

**Prototype-first challenges:**
```
"Should I write a PRD for this recommendation engine or prototype it first?"
```

**Apply frameworks:**
```
"Apply the Four Risks framework to this feature: [describe feature]"
```

**Roadmap planning:**
```
"Help me create a Now-Next-Later roadmap from these projects: [paste projects]"
```

### Using Slash Commands

**Prioritize your backlog:**
```
/lno-prioritize
/lno-prioritize --team product
/lno-prioritize --label  (adds Linear labels)
```

**Risk assessment:**
```
/four-risks ENG-245
/four-risks --current-sprint
/four-risks --add-comment  (adds assessment to Linear)
```

**Roadmap generation:**
```
/now-next-later
/now-next-later --team engineering
/now-next-later --export  (generates markdown)
```

**Organizational AI adoption:**
```
/coder
/coder --diagnose
```

**PMF measurement:**
```
/pmf-survey
/pmf-survey --create
/pmf-survey --analyze [survey-data]
```

```bash
cd pm-thought-partner
git pull
claude plugin update pm-thought-partner
```

**Claude Code Browser:**
Claude will notify you when updates are available.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not showing in list
- Verify `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists in the repo
- Try: `claude plugin install --force .`

### Slash commands not working
- Verify command files exist in `commands/` directory
- Check command syntax: `/command-name` (use hyphens, not spaces)
- Try restarting Claude Code

### Linear integration not working
- Verify Linear API key is correct: `claude mcp list`
- Check Linear MCP is running: `claude mcp status linear`
- Test connection: Ask Claude "List my Linear issues"

### Commands return "No Linear issues found"
- Verify you have active Linear issues in your workspace
- Check Linear API key has correct permissions
- Try: `/lno-prioritize --team [your-team-name]`

## What's Next?

1. **Try the slash commands** - Start with `/lno-prioritize` to see frameworks in action
2. **Connect Linear** (if you use it) - Apply frameworks to your actual backlog
3. **Explore frameworks** - Browse [`frameworks/`](frameworks/) to see what's available
4. **Share feedback** - What frameworks are missing? What would make this more useful?

**Happy shipping! ðŸš€**
